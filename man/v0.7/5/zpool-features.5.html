</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">ZFS pool on-disk format versions are specified via
    &quot;features&quot; which replace the old on-disk format numbers (the last
    supported on-disk format number is 28). To enable a feature on a pool use
    the <b>upgrade</b> subcommand of the <b>zpool</b>(8) command, or set the
    <b>feature@</b><i>feature_name</i> property to <b>enabled</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The pool format does not affect file system version compatibility
    or the ability to send file systems between pools.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Since most features can be enabled independently of each other the
    on-disk format of the pool is specified by the set of all features marked as
    <b>active</b> on the pool. If the pool was created by another software
    version this set may include unsupported features.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Identifying_features"><a class="permalink" href="#Identifying_features">Identifying
  features</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Every feature has a guid of the form
    <i>com.example:feature_name</i>. The reverse DNS name ensures that the
    feature's guid is unique across all ZFS implementations. When unsupported
    features are encountered on a pool they will be identified by their guids.
    Refer to the documentation for the ZFS implementation that created the pool
    for information about those features.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Each supported feature also has a short name. By convention a
    feature's short name is the portion of its guid which follows the ':' (e.g.
    <i>com.example:feature_name</i> would have the short name
    <i>feature_name</i>), however a feature's short name may differ across ZFS
    implementations if following the convention would result in name
  conflicts.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Feature_states"><a class="permalink" href="#Feature_states">Feature
  states</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Features can be in one of three states:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b></b><b>active</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This feature's on-disk format changes are in effect on
  the pool. Support for this feature is required to import the pool in
  read-write mode. If this feature is not read-only compatible, support is also
  required to import the pool in read-only mode (see &quot;Read-only
  compatibility&quot;).</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"><b></b><b>enabled</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">An administrator has marked this feature as enabled on
  the pool, but the feature's on-disk format changes have not been made yet. The
  pool can still be imported by software that does not support this feature, but
  changes may be made to the on-disk format at any time which will move the
  feature to the <b>active</b> state. Some features may support returning to the
  <b>enabled</b> state after becoming <b>active</b>. See feature-specific
  documentation for details.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"><b>disabled</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This feature's on-disk format changes have not been made
  and will not be made unless an administrator moves the feature to the
  <b>enabled</b> state. Features cannot be disabled once they have been
  enabled.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The state of supported features is exposed through pool properties
    of the form <i>feature@short_name</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Read"><a class="permalink" href="#Read">Read-only
  compatibility</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Some features may make on-disk format changes that do not
    interfere with other software's ability to read from the pool. These
    features are referred to as &quot;read-only compatible&quot;. If all
    unsupported features on a pool are read-only compatible, the pool can be
    imported in read-only mode by setting the <b>readonly</b> property during
    import (see <b>zpool</b>(8) for details on importing pools).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Unsupported_features"><a class="permalink" href="#Unsupported_features">Unsupported
  features</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">For each unsupported feature enabled on an imported pool a pool
    property named <i>unsupported@feature_guid</i> will indicate why the import
    was allowed despite the unsupported feature. Possible values for this
    property are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"><b></b><b>inactive</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The feature is in the <b>enabled</b> state and therefore
  the pool's on-disk format is still compatible with software that does not
  support this feature.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"><b></b><b>readonly</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The feature is read-only compatible and the pool has been
  imported in read-only mode.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Feature_dependencies"><a class="permalink" href="#Feature_dependencies">Feature
  dependencies</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Some features depend on other features being enabled in order to
    function properly. Enabling a feature will automatically enable any features
    it depends on.</p>
</section>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="FEATURES"><a class="permalink" href="#FEATURES">FEATURES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The following features are supported on this system:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b></b><b>async_destroy</b></p>

  <tr>
    <td>DEPENDENCIES</td>
    <td>none</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="Pp">Destroying a file system requires traversing all of its data in
    order to return its used space to the pool. Without <b>async_destroy</b> the
    file system is not fully removed until all space has been reclaimed. If the
    destroy operation is interrupted by a reboot or power outage the next
    attempt to open the pool will need to complete the destroy operation
    synchronously.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>async_destroy</b> is enabled the file system's data will
    be reclaimed by a background process, allowing the destroy operation to
    complete without traversing the entire file system. The background process
    is able to resume interrupted destroys after the pool has been opened,
    eliminating the need to finish interrupted destroys as part of the open
    operation. The amount of space remaining to be reclaimed by the background
    process is available through the <b>freeing</b> property.</p>
<p class="Pp">This feature is only <b>active</b> while <b>freeing</b> is
    non-zero.</p>

<p class="Pp">This feature increases the performance of creating and using a
    large number of snapshots of a single filesystem or volume, and also reduces
    the disk space required.</p>
<p class="Pp">When there are many snapshots, each snapshot uses many Block
    Pointer Objects (bpobj's) to track blocks associated with that snapshot.
    However, in common use cases, most of these bpobj's are empty. This feature
    allows us to create each bpobj on-demand, thus eliminating the empty
  bpobjs.</p>

<p class="Pp"><b>lz4</b> is a high-performance real-time compression algorithm
    that features significantly faster compression and decompression as well as
    a higher compression ratio than the older <b>lzjb</b> compression.
    Typically, <b>lz4</b> compression is approximately 50% faster on
    compressible data and 200% faster on incompressible data than <b>lzjb</b>.
    It is also approximately 80% faster on decompression, while giving
    approximately 10% better compression ratio.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the <b>lz4_compress</b> feature is set to <b>enabled</b>, the
    administrator can turn on <b>lz4</b> compression on any dataset on the pool
    using the <b>zfs</b>(8) command. Please note that doing so will immediately
    activate the <b>lz4_compress</b> feature on the underlying pool using the
    <b>zfs</b>(1M) command. Also, all newly written metadata will be compressed
    with <b>lz4</b> algorithm. Since this feature is not read-only compatible,
    this operation will render the pool unimportable on systems without support
    for the <b>lz4_compress</b> feature.</p>
<p class="Pp">Booting off of <b>lz4</b>-compressed root pools is supported.</p>
<p class="Pp">This feature becomes <b>active</b> as soon as it is enabled and

<p class="Pp">This feature improves performance of incremental sends (&quot;zfs

<p class="Pp">An incremental send stream from snapshot <b>A</b> to snapshot
    <b>B</b> contains information about every block that changed between
    <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>. Blocks which did not change between those snapshots
    can be identified and omitted from the stream using a piece of metadata
    called the 'block birth time', but birth times are not recorded for holes
    (blocks filled only with zeroes). Since holes created after <b>A</b> cannot
    be distinguished from holes created before <b>A</b>, information about every
    hole in the entire filesystem or zvol is included in the send stream.</p>
<p class="Pp">For workloads where holes are rare this is not a problem. However,
    when incrementally replicating filesystems or zvols with many holes (for
    example a zvol formatted with another filesystem) a lot of time will be
    spent sending and receiving unnecessary information about holes that already
    exist on the receiving side.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once the <b>hole_birth</b> feature has been enabled the block
    birth times of all new holes will be recorded. Incremental sends between

    location on disk). Thus the space of the block (one sector, typically 512
    bytes or 4KB) is saved, and no additional i/o is needed to read and write
    the data block.</p>

<p class="Pp">This feature enables the use of the SHA-512/256 truncated hash
    algorithm (FIPS 180-4) for checksum and dedup. The native 64-bit arithmetic
    of SHA-512 provides an approximate 50% performance boost over SHA-256 on
    64-bit hardware and is thus a good minimum-change replacement candidate for
    systems where hash performance is important, but these systems cannot for
    whatever reason utilize the faster <b>skein</b> and <b>edonr</b>
  algorithms.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the <b>sha512</b> feature is set to <b>enabled</b>, the

<p class="Pp">This feature enables the use of the Skein hash algorithm for
    checksum and dedup. Skein is a high-performance secure hash algorithm that
    was a finalist in the NIST SHA-3 competition. It provides a very high
    security margin and high performance on 64-bit hardware (80% faster than
    SHA-256). This implementation also utilizes the new salted checksumming
    functionality in ZFS, which means that the checksum is pre-seeded with a
    secret 256-bit random key (stored on the pool) before being fed the data
    block to be checksummed. Thus the produced checksums are unique to a given
    pool, preventing hash collision attacks on systems with dedup.</p>

<p class="Pp">This feature enables the use of the Edon-R hash algorithm for

    overwrite of a block whose checksum matches the data being written will be
    ignored). In an abundance of caution, Edon-R can not be used with dedup
    (without verification).</p>
<p class="Pp">Edon-R is a very high-performance hash algorithm that was part of
    the NIST SHA-3 competition. It provides extremely high hash performance
    (over 350% faster than SHA-256), but was not selected because of its
    unsuitability as a general purpose secure hash algorithm. This
    implementation utilizes the new salted checksumming functionality in ZFS,
    which means that the checksum is pre-seeded with a secret 256-bit random key
