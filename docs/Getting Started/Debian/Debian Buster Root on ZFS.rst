Overview

Caution
~~~~~~~

- This HOWTO uses a whole physical disk.
- Do not use these instructions for dual-booting.
- Backup your data. Any existing data will be lost.

System Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `64-bit Debian GNU/Linux Buster Live CD w/ GUI (e.g. gnome iso)
  <https://cdimage.debian.org/mirror/cdimage/release/current-live/amd64/iso-hybrid/>`__
- `A 64-bit kernel is strongly encouraged.
  <https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/wiki/FAQ#32-bit-vs-64-bit-systems>`__
- Installing on a drive which presents 4 KiB logical sectors (a “4Kn” drive)
  only works with UEFI booting. This not unique to ZFS. `GRUB does not and
  will not work on 4Kn with legacy (BIOS) booting.
  <http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?46700>`__

Computers that have less than 2 GiB of memory run ZFS slowly. 4 GiB of memory
is recommended for normal performance in basic workloads. If you wish to use
deduplication, you will need `massive amounts of RAM
<http://wiki.freebsd.org/ZFSTuningGuide#Deduplication>`__. Enabling
deduplication is a permanent change that cannot be easily reverted.

Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~

This guide supports three different encryption options: unencrypted, ZFS
native encryption, and LUKS. With any option, all ZFS features are fully
available.

Unencrypted does not encrypt anything, of course. With no encryption
happening, this option naturally has the best performance.

ZFS native encryption encrypts the data and most metadata in the root
pool. It does not encrypt dataset or snapshot names or properties. The
boot pool is not encrypted at all, but it only contains the bootloader,
kernel, and initrd. (Unless you put a password in ``/etc/fstab``, the
initrd is unlikely to contain sensitive data.) The system cannot boot
without the passphrase being entered at the console. Performance is
good. As the encryption happens in ZFS, even if multiple disks (mirror
or raidz topologies) are used, the data only has to be encrypted once.

LUKS encrypts almost everything. The only unencrypted data is the bootloader,
kernel, and initrd. The system cannot boot without the passphrase being
entered at the console. Performance is good, but LUKS sits underneath ZFS, so
if multiple disks (mirror or raidz topologies) are used, the data has to be
encrypted once per disk.

Step 1: Prepare The Install Environment
---------------------------------------

#. Boot the Debian GNU/Linux Live CD. If prompted, login with the username
   ``user`` and password ``live``. Connect your system to the Internet as
   appropriate (e.g. join your WiFi network). Open a terminal.

#. Setup and update the repositories::

     sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list

   .. code-block:: sourceslist

     deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster main contrib
     deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian buster main contrib

   ::

     sudo apt update

#. Optional: Install and start the OpenSSH server in the Live CD environment:

   If you have a second system, using SSH to access the target system can be
   convenient::

     sudo apt install --yes openssh-server
     sudo systemctl restart ssh

   **Hint:** You can find your IP address with
   ``ip addr show scope global | grep inet``. Then, from your main machine,
   connect with ``ssh user@IP``.

#. Become root::

     sudo -i

#. Install ZFS in the Live CD environment::

     apt install --yes debootstrap gdisk dkms dpkg-dev \
         linux-headers-$(uname -r)
     apt install --yes -t buster-backports --no-install-recommends zfs-dkms
     modprobe zfs
     apt install --yes -t buster-backports zfsutils-linux

   - The dkms dependency is installed manually just so it comes from buster
     and not buster-backports. This is not critical.
   - We need to get the module built and loaded before installing
     zfsutils-linux or `zfs-mount.service will fail to start
     <https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/issues/9599>`__.

Step 2: Disk Formatting
-----------------------

#. Set a variable with the disk name::

     DISK=/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA_disk1

   Always use the long ``/dev/disk/by-id/*`` aliases with ZFS. Using the
   ``/dev/sd*`` device nodes directly can cause sporadic import failures,
   especially on systems that have more than one storage pool.

   **Hints:**

   - ``ls -la /dev/disk/by-id`` will list the aliases.
   - Are you doing this in a virtual machine? If your virtual disk is missing
     from ``/dev/disk/by-id``, use ``/dev/vda`` if you are using KVM with
     virtio; otherwise, read the `troubleshooting <#troubleshooting>`__
     section.

#. If you are re-using a disk, clear it as necessary:

   If the disk was previously used in an MD array::

     apt install --yes mdadm

     # See if one or more MD arrays are active:
     cat /proc/mdstat
     # If so, stop them (replace ``md0`` as required):
     mdadm --stop /dev/md0

     # For an array using the whole disk:
     mdadm --zero-superblock --force $DISK
     # For an array using a partition:
     mdadm --zero-superblock --force ${DISK}-part2

   Clear the partition table::

     sgdisk --zap-all $DISK

   If you get a message about the kernel still using the old partition table,
   reboot and start over (except that you can skip this step).


#. Partition your disk(s):

   Run this if you need legacy (BIOS) booting::

     sgdisk -a1 -n1:24K:+1000K -t1:EF02 $DISK

   Run this for UEFI booting (for use now or in the future)::

     sgdisk     -n2:1M:+512M   -t2:EF00 $DISK

   Run this for the boot pool::

     sgdisk     -n3:0:+1G      -t3:BF01 $DISK

   Choose one of the following options:

   - Unencrypted or ZFS native encryption::

       sgdisk     -n4:0:0        -t4:BF00 $DISK

   - LUKS::

       sgdisk     -n4:0:0        -t4:8309 $DISK

   If you are creating a mirror or raidz topology, repeat the partitioning
   commands for all the disks which will be part of the pool.

#. Create the boot pool::

     zpool create \
         -o ashift=12 -d \
         -o feature@async_destroy=enabled \
         -o feature@bookmarks=enabled \
         -o feature@embedded_data=enabled \
         -o feature@empty_bpobj=enabled \
         -o feature@enabled_txg=enabled \
         -o feature@extensible_dataset=enabled \
         -o feature@filesystem_limits=enabled \
         -o feature@hole_birth=enabled \
         -o feature@large_blocks=enabled \
         -o feature@lz4_compress=enabled \
         -o feature@spacemap_histogram=enabled \
         -o feature@zpool_checkpoint=enabled \
         -O acltype=posixacl -O canmount=off -O compression=lz4 \
         -O devices=off -O normalization=formD -O relatime=on -O xattr=sa \
         -O mountpoint=/boot -R /mnt \
         bpool ${DISK}-part3

   You should not need to customize any of the options for the boot pool.

   GRUB does not support all of the zpool features. See ``spa_feature_names``
   in `grub-core/fs/zfs/zfs.c
   <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/grub.git/tree/grub-core/fs/zfs/zfs.c#n276>`__.
   This step creates a separate boot pool for ``/boot`` with the features
   limited to only those that GRUB supports, allowing the root pool to use
   any/all features. Note that GRUB opens the pool read-only, so all
   read-only compatible features are “supported” by GRUB.

   **Hints:**

   - If you are creating a mirror topology, create the pool using::

       zpool create \
           ... \
           bpool mirror \
           /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA_disk1-part3 \
           /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA_disk2-part3

   - For raidz topologies, replace ``mirror`` in the above command with
     ``raidz``, ``raidz2``, or  ``raidz3`` and list the partitions from
     additional disks.
   - The pool name is arbitrary. If changed, the new name must be used
     consistently. The ``bpool`` convention originated in this HOWTO.

   **Feature Notes:**

   - The ``allocation_classes`` feature should be safe to use. However, unless
     one is using it (i.e. a ``special`` vdev), there is no point to enabling
     it. It is extremely unlikely that someone would use this feature for a
     boot pool. If one cares about speeding up the boot pool, it would make
     more sense to put the whole pool on the faster disk rather than using it
     as a ``special`` vdev.
   - The ``project_quota`` feature has been tested and is safe to use. This
     feature is extremely unlikely to matter for the boot pool.
   - The ``resilver_defer`` should be safe but the boot pool is small enough
     that it is unlikely to be necessary.
   - The ``spacemap_v2`` feature has been tested and is safe to use. The boot
     pool is small, so this does not matter in practice.
   - As a read-only compatible feature, the ``userobj_accounting`` feature
     should be compatible in theory, but in practice, GRUB can fail with an
     “invalid dnode type” error. This feature does not matter for ``/boot``
     anyway.

#. Create the root pool:

   Choose one of the following options:

   - Unencrypted::

       zpool create \
           -o ashift=12 \
           -O acltype=posixacl -O canmount=off -O compression=lz4 \
           -O dnodesize=auto -O normalization=formD -O relatime=on \
           -O xattr=sa -O mountpoint=/ -R /mnt \
           rpool ${DISK}-part4

   - ZFS native encryption::

       zpool create \
           -o ashift=12 \
           -O encryption=aes-256-gcm \
           -O keylocation=prompt -O keyformat=passphrase \
           -O acltype=posixacl -O canmount=off -O compression=lz4 \
           -O dnodesize=auto -O normalization=formD -O relatime=on \
           -O xattr=sa -O mountpoint=/ -R /mnt \
           rpool ${DISK}-part4

   - LUKS::

       apt install --yes cryptsetup
       cryptsetup luksFormat -c aes-xts-plain64 -s 512 -h sha256 ${DISK}-part4
       cryptsetup luksOpen ${DISK}-part4 luks1
       zpool create \
           -o ashift=12 \
           -O acltype=posixacl -O canmount=off -O compression=lz4 \
           -O dnodesize=auto -O normalization=formD -O relatime=on \
           -O xattr=sa -O mountpoint=/ -R /mnt \
           rpool /dev/mapper/luks1

   **Notes:**

   - The use of ``ashift=12`` is recommended here because many drives
     today have 4 KiB (or larger) physical sectors, even though they
     present 512 B logical sectors. Also, a future replacement drive may
     have 4 KiB physical sectors (in which case ``ashift=12`` is desirable)
     or 4 KiB logical sectors (in which case ``ashift=12`` is required).
   - Setting ``-O acltype=posixacl`` enables POSIX ACLs globally. If you
     do not want this, remove that option, but later add
     ``-o acltype=posixacl`` (note: lowercase “o”) to the ``zfs create``
     for ``/var/log``, as `journald requires ACLs
     <https://askubuntu.com/questions/970886/journalctl-says-failed-to-search-journal-acl-operation-not-supported>`__
   - Setting ``normalization=formD`` eliminates some corner cases relating
     to UTF-8 filename normalization. It also implies ``utf8only=on``,
     which means that only UTF-8 filenames are allowed. If you care to
     support non-UTF-8 filenames, do not use this option. For a discussion
     of why requiring UTF-8 filenames may be a bad idea, see `The problems
     with enforced UTF-8 only filenames
     <http://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/ForcedUTF8Filenames>`__.
   - ``recordsize`` is unset (leaving it at the default of 128 KiB). If you
     want to tune it (e.g. ``-o recordsize=1M``), see `these
     <https://jrs-s.net/2019/04/03/on-zfs-recordsize/>`__ `various
     <http://blog.programster.org/zfs-record-size>`__ `blog
     <https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/solaris/ZFSFileRecordsizeGrowth>`__
     `posts
     <https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/solaris/ZFSRecordsizeAndCompression>`__.
   - Setting ``relatime=on`` is a middle ground between classic POSIX
     ``atime`` behavior (with its significant performance impact) and
     ``atime=off`` (which provides the best performance by completely
     disabling atime updates). Since Linux 2.6.30, ``relatime`` has been
     the default for other filesystems. See `RedHat’s documentation
     <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/power_management_guide/relatime>`__
     for further information.
   - Setting ``xattr=sa`` `vastly improves the performance of extended
     attributes
     <https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/commit/82a37189aac955c81a59a5ecc3400475adb56355>`__.
     Inside ZFS, extended attributes are used to implement POSIX ACLs.
     Extended attributes can also be used by user-space applications.
     `They are used by some desktop GUI applications.
     <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_file_attributes#Linux>`__
     `They can be used by Samba to store Windows ACLs and DOS attributes;
     they are required for a Samba Active Directory domain controller.
     <https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Setting_up_a_Share_Using_Windows_ACLs>`__
     Note that ``xattr=sa`` is `Linux-specific
     <http://open-zfs.org/wiki/Platform_code_differences>`__. If you move your
     ``xattr=sa`` pool to another OpenZFS implementation besides ZFS-on-Linux,
     extended attributes will not be readable (though your data will be). If
     portability of extended attributes is important to you, omit the
     ``-O xattr=sa`` above. Even if you do not want ``xattr=sa`` for the whole
     pool, it is probably fine to use it for ``/var/log``.
   - Make sure to include the ``-part4`` portion of the drive path. If you
     forget that, you are specifying the whole disk, which ZFS will then
     re-partition, and you will lose the bootloader partition(s).
   - ZFS native encryption `now
     <https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/commit/31b160f0a6c673c8f926233af2ed6d5354808393>`__
     defaults to ``aes-256-gcm``.
   - For LUKS, the key size chosen is 512 bits. However, XTS mode requires two
     keys, so the LUKS key is split in half. Thus, ``-s 512`` means AES-256.
   - Your passphrase will likely be the weakest link. Choose wisely. See
     `section 5 of the cryptsetup FAQ
     <https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/wikis/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#5-security-aspects>`__
     for guidance.

   **Hints:**

   - If you are creating a mirror topology, create the pool using::

       zpool create \
           ... \
           bpool mirror \
           /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA_disk1-part3 \
           /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA_disk2-part3

   - For raidz topologies, replace ``mirror`` in the above command with
     ``raidz``, ``raidz2``, or  ``raidz3`` and list the partitions from
     additional disks.
   - When using LUKS with mirror or raidz topologies, use
     ``/dev/mapper/luks1``, ``/dev/mapper/luks2``, etc., which you will have
     to create using ``cryptsetup``.
   - The pool name is arbitrary. If changed, the new name must be used
     consistently. On systems that can automatically install to ZFS, the root
     pool is named ``rpool`` by default.

Step 3: System Installation
---------------------------

#. Create filesystem datasets to act as containers::

     zfs create -o canmount=off -o mountpoint=none rpool/ROOT
     zfs create -o canmount=off -o mountpoint=none bpool/BOOT

   On Solaris systems, the root filesystem is cloned and the suffix is
   incremented for major system changes through ``pkg image-update`` or
   ``beadm``. Similar functionality has been implemented in Ubuntu 20.04 with
   the ``zsys`` tool, though its dataset layout is more complicated. Even
   without such a tool, the `rpool/ROOT` and `bpool/BOOT` containers can still
   be used for manually created clones. That said, this HOWTO assumes a single
   filesystem for ``/boot`` for simplicity.

#. Create filesystem datasets for the root and boot filesystems::

     zfs create -o canmount=noauto -o mountpoint=/ rpool/ROOT/debian
     zfs mount rpool/ROOT/debian

     zfs create -o mountpoint=/boot bpool/BOOT/debian
     zfs mount bpool/BOOT/debian

   With ZFS, it is not normally necessary to use a mount command (either
   ``mount`` or ``zfs mount``). This situation is an exception because of
   ``canmount=noauto``.

#. Create datasets::

     zfs create                                 rpool/home
     zfs create -o mountpoint=/root             rpool/home/root
     zfs create -o canmount=off                 rpool/var
     zfs create -o canmount=off                 rpool/var/lib
     zfs create                                 rpool/var/log
     zfs create                                 rpool/var/spool

   The datasets below are optional, depending on your preferences and/or
   software choices.

   If you wish to exclude these from snapshots::

     zfs create -o com.sun:auto-snapshot=false  rpool/var/cache
     zfs create -o com.sun:auto-snapshot=false  rpool/var/tmp
     chmod 1777 /mnt/var/tmp

   If you use /opt on this system::

     zfs create                                 rpool/opt

   If you use /srv on this system::

     zfs create                                 rpool/srv

   If you use /usr/local on this system::

     zfs create -o canmount=off                 rpool/usr
     zfs create                                 rpool/usr/local

   If this system will have games installed::

     zfs create                                 rpool/var/games

   If this system will store local email in /var/mail::

     zfs create                                 rpool/var/mail

   If this system will use Snap packages::

     zfs create                                 rpool/var/snap

   If you use /var/www on this system::

     zfs create                                 rpool/var/www

   If this system will use GNOME::

     zfs create                                 rpool/var/lib/AccountsService

   If this system will use Docker (which manages its own datasets &
   snapshots)::

     zfs create -o com.sun:auto-snapshot=false  rpool/var/lib/docker

   If this system will use NFS (locking)::

     zfs create -o com.sun:auto-snapshot=false  rpool/var/lib/nfs

   A tmpfs is recommended later, but if you want a separate dataset for
   ``/tmp``::

     zfs create -o com.sun:auto-snapshot=false  rpool/tmp
     chmod 1777 /mnt/tmp

   The primary goal of this dataset layout is to separate the OS from user
   data. This allows the root filesystem to be rolled back without rolling
   back user data.

   If you do nothing extra, ``/tmp`` will be stored as part of the root
   filesystem. Alternatively, you can create a separate dataset for ``/tmp``,
   as shown above. This keeps the ``/tmp`` data out of snapshots of your root
   filesystem. It also allows you to set a quota on ``rpool/tmp``, if you want
   to limit the maximum space used. Otherwise, you can use a tmpfs (RAM
   filesystem) later.

#. Install the minimal system::

     debootstrap buster /mnt

   The ``debootstrap`` command leaves the new system in an unconfigured state.
   An alternative to using ``debootstrap`` is to copy the entirety of a
   working system into the new ZFS root.

Step 4: System Configuration
----------------------------

#. Configure the hostname:

   Replace ``HOSTNAME`` with the desired hostname::

     echo HOSTNAME > /mnt/etc/hostname
     vi /mnt/etc/hosts

   .. code-block:: text

     Add a line:
     127.0.1.1       HOSTNAME
     or if the system has a real name in DNS:
     127.0.1.1       FQDN HOSTNAME

   **Hint:** Use ``nano`` if you find ``vi`` confusing.

#. Configure the network interface:

   Find the interface name::

     ip addr show

   Adjust ``NAME`` below to match your interface name::

     vi /mnt/etc/network/interfaces.d/NAME

   .. code-block:: text

     auto NAME
     iface NAME inet dhcp

   Customize this file if the system is not a DHCP client.

#. Configure the package sources::

     vi /mnt/etc/apt/sources.list

   .. code-block:: sourceslist

     deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster main contrib
     deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian buster main contrib

   ::

     vi /mnt/etc/apt/sources.list.d/buster-backports.list

   .. code-block:: sourceslist

     deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster-backports main contrib
     deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian buster-backports main contrib

   ::

     vi /mnt/etc/apt/preferences.d/90_zfs

   .. code-block:: control

     Package: libnvpair1linux libuutil1linux libzfs2linux libzfslinux-dev libzpool2linux python3-pyzfs pyzfs-doc spl spl-dkms zfs-dkms zfs-dracut zfs-initramfs zfs-test zfsutils-linux zfsutils-linux-dev zfs-zed
     Pin: release n=buster-backports
     Pin-Priority: 990

#. Bind the virtual filesystems from the LiveCD environment to the new
   system and ``chroot`` into it::

     mount --rbind /dev  /mnt/dev
     mount --rbind /proc /mnt/proc
     mount --rbind /sys  /mnt/sys
     chroot /mnt /usr/bin/env DISK=$DISK bash --login

   **Note:** This is using ``--rbind``, not ``--bind``.

#. Configure a basic system environment::

     ln -s /proc/self/mounts /etc/mtab
     apt update

     apt install --yes locales
     dpkg-reconfigure locales

   Even if you prefer a non-English system language, always ensure that
   ``en_US.UTF-8`` is available::

     dpkg-reconfigure tzdata

#. Install ZFS in the chroot environment for the new system::

     apt install --yes dpkg-dev linux-headers-amd64 linux-image-amd64
     apt install --yes zfs-initramfs
     echo REMAKE_INITRD=yes > /etc/dkms/zfs.conf

#. For LUKS installs only, setup ``/etc/crypttab``::

     apt install --yes cryptsetup

     echo luks1 UUID=$(blkid -s UUID -o value ${DISK}-part4) none \
         luks,discard,initramfs > /etc/crypttab

   The use of ``initramfs`` is a work-around for `cryptsetup does not support
   ZFS <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cryptsetup/+bug/1612906>`__.

   **Hint:** If you are creating a mirror or raidz topology, repeat the
   ``/etc/crypttab`` entries for ``luks2``, etc. adjusting for each disk.

#. Install GRUB

   Choose one of the following options:

   - Install GRUB for legacy (BIOS) booting::

       apt install --yes grub-pc

     Select (using the space bar) all of the disks (not partitions) in your
     pool.

   - Install GRUB for UEFI booting::

        apt install dosfstools
        mkdosfs -F 32 -s 1 -n EFI ${DISK}-part2
        mkdir /boot/efi
        echo PARTUUID=$(blkid -s PARTUUID -o value ${DISK}-part2) \
           /boot/efi vfat nofail,x-systemd.device-timeout=1 0 1 >> /etc/fstab
        mount /boot/efi
        apt install --yes grub-efi-amd64 shim-signed

      **Notes:**

     - The ``-s 1`` for ``mkdosfs`` is only necessary for drives which present
        4 KiB logical sectors (“4Kn” drives) to meet the minimum cluster size
        (given the partition size of 512 MiB) for FAT32. It also works fine on
        drives which present 512 B sectors.
     - For a mirror or raidz topology, this step only installs GRUB on the
       first disk. The other disk(s) will be handled later.

#. Optional: Remove os-prober::

     dpkg --purge os-prober

   This avoids error messages from `update-grub`.  `os-prober` is only
   necessary in dual-boot configurations.

#. Set a root password::

     passwd

#. Enable importing bpool

   This ensures that ``bpool`` is always imported, regardless of whether
   ``/etc/zfs/zpool.cache`` exists, whether it is in the cachefile or not,
   or whether ``zfs-import-scan.service`` is enabled.

   ::

         vi /etc/systemd/system/zfs-import-bpool.service

   .. code-block:: ini

         [Unit]
         DefaultDependencies=no
         Before=zfs-import-scan.service
         Before=zfs-import-cache.service

         [Service]
         Type=oneshot
         RemainAfterExit=yes
         ExecStart=/sbin/zpool import -N -o cachefile=none bpool

         [Install]
         WantedBy=zfs-import.target

   ::

     systemctl enable zfs-import-bpool.service

#. Optional (but recommended): Mount a tmpfs to ``/tmp``

   If you chose to create a ``/tmp`` dataset above, skip this step, as they
   are mutually exclusive choices. Otherwise, you can put ``/tmp`` on a
   tmpfs (RAM filesystem) by enabling the ``tmp.mount`` unit.

   ::

     cp /usr/share/systemd/tmp.mount /etc/systemd/system/
     systemctl enable tmp.mount

#. Optional (but kindly requested): Install popcon

   The ``popularity-contest`` package reports the list of packages install
   on your system. Showing that ZFS is popular may be helpful in terms of
   long-term attention from the distro.

   ::

     apt install --yes popularity-contest

   Choose Yes at the prompt.

Step 5: GRUB Installation
-------------------------

#. Verify that the ZFS boot filesystem is recognized::

     grub-probe /boot

#. Refresh the initrd files::

     update-initramfs -c -k all

   **Note:** When using LUKS, this will print “WARNING could not determine
   root device from /etc/fstab”. This is because `cryptsetup does not
   support ZFS
   <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cryptsetup/+bug/1612906>`__.

#. Workaround GRUB's missing zpool-features support::

     vi /etc/default/grub
     # Set: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="root=ZFS=rpool/ROOT/debian"

#. Optional (but highly recommended): Make debugging GRUB easier::

     vi /etc/default/grub
     # Remove quiet from: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT
     # Uncomment: GRUB_TERMINAL=console
     # Save and quit.

   Later, once the system has rebooted twice and you are sure everything is
   working, you can undo these changes, if desired.

#. Update the boot configuration::

     update-grub

   **Note:** Ignore errors from ``osprober``, if present.

#. Install the boot loader:

   #. For legacy (BIOS) booting, install GRUB to the MBR::

        grub-install $DISK

   Note that you are installing GRUB to the whole disk, not a partition.

   If you are creating a mirror or raidz topology, repeat the ``grub-install``
   command for each disk in the pool.

   #. For UEFI booting, install GRUB to the ESP::

        grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi \
            --bootloader-id=debian --recheck --no-floppy

      It is not necessary to specify the disk here. If you are creating a
      mirror or raidz topology, the additional disks will be handled later.

#. Fix filesystem mount ordering:

   We need to activate ``zfs-mount-generator``. This makes systemd aware of
   the separate mountpoints, which is important for things like ``/var/log``
   and ``/var/tmp``. In turn, ``rsyslog.service`` depends on ``var-log.mount``
   by way of ``local-fs.target`` and services using the ``PrivateTmp`` feature
   of systemd automatically use ``After=var-tmp.mount``.

   ::

     mkdir /etc/zfs/zfs-list.cache
     touch /etc/zfs/zfs-list.cache/bpool
     touch /etc/zfs/zfs-list.cache/rpool
     ln -s /usr/lib/zfs-linux/zed.d/history_event-zfs-list-cacher.sh /etc/zfs/zed.d
     zed -F &

   Verify that ``zed`` updated the cache by making sure these are not empty::

     cat /etc/zfs/zfs-list.cache/bpool
     cat /etc/zfs/zfs-list.cache/rpool

   If either is empty, force a cache update and check again::

     zfs set canmount=on     bpool/BOOT/debian
     zfs set canmount=noauto rpool/ROOT/debian

   Stop ``zed``::

     fg
     Press Ctrl-C.

   Fix the paths to eliminate ``/mnt``::

     sed -Ei "s|/mnt/?|/|" /etc/zfs/zfs-list.cache/*

Step 6: First Boot
------------------

#. Optional: Install SSH::

     apt install --yes openssh-server

     vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     # Set: PermitRootLogin yes

#. Optional: Snapshot the initial installation::

     zfs snapshot bpool/BOOT/debian@install
     zfs snapshot rpool/ROOT/debian@install

   In the future, you will likely want to take snapshots before each
   upgrade, and remove old snapshots (including this one) at some point to
   save space.

#. Exit from the ``chroot`` environment back to the LiveCD environment::

     exit

#. Run these commands in the LiveCD environment to unmount all
   filesystems::

     mount | grep -v zfs | tac | awk '/\/mnt/ {print $3}' | \
         xargs -i{} umount -lf {}
     zpool export -a

#. Reboot::

     reboot

   Wait for the newly installed system to boot normally. Login as root.

#. Create a user account:

   Replace ``username`` with your desired username::

     zfs create rpool/home/username
     adduser username

     cp -a /etc/skel/. /home/username
     chown -R username:username /home/username
     usermod -a -G audio,cdrom,dip,floppy,netdev,plugdev,sudo,video username

#. Mirror GRUB

   If you installed to multiple disks, install GRUB on the additional
   disks.

   - For legacy (BIOS) booting::

       dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc

     Hit enter until you get to the device selection screen.
     Select (using the space bar) all of the disks (not partitions) in your pool.

   - For UEFI booting::

       umount /boot/efi

     For the second and subsequent disks (increment debian-2 to -3, etc.)::

       dd if=/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA_disk1-part2 \
          of=/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA_disk2-part2
       efibootmgr -c -g -d /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA_disk2 \
           -p 2 -L "debian-2" -l '\EFI\debian\grubx64.efi'

       mount /boot/efi

Step 7: Optional: Configure Swap
---------------------------------

**Caution**: On systems with extremely high memory pressure, using a
zvol for swap can result in lockup, regardless of how much swap is still
available. There is `a bug report upstrea
<https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/issues/7734>`__.

#. Create a volume dataset (zvol) for use as a swap device::

     zfs create -V 4G -b $(getconf PAGESIZE) -o compression=zle \
         -o logbias=throughput -o sync=always \
         -o primarycache=metadata -o secondarycache=none \
         -o com.sun:auto-snapshot=false rpool/swap

   You can adjust the size (the ``4G`` part) to your needs.

   The compression algorithm is set to ``zle`` because it is the cheapest
   available algorithm. As this guide recommends ``ashift=12`` (4 kiB
   blocks on disk), the common case of a 4 kiB page size means that no
   compression algorithm can reduce I/O. The exception is all-zero pages,
   which are dropped by ZFS; but some form of compression has to be enabled
   to get this behavior.

#. Configure the swap device:

   **Caution**: Always use long ``/dev/zvol`` aliases in configuration
   files. Never use a short ``/dev/zdX`` device name.

   ::

     mkswap -f /dev/zvol/rpool/swap
     echo /dev/zvol/rpool/swap none swap discard 0 0 >> /etc/fstab
     echo RESUME=none > /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume

   The ``RESUME=none`` is necessary to disable resuming from hibernation.
   This does not work, as the zvol is not present (because the pool has not
   yet been imported) at the time the resume script runs. If it is not
   disabled, the boot process hangs for 30 seconds waiting for the swap
   zvol to appear.

#. Enable the swap device::

     swapon -av

Step 8: Full Software Installation
----------------------------------

#. Upgrade the minimal system::

     apt dist-upgrade --yes

#. Install a regular set of software:

     tasksel

#. Optional: Disable log compression:

   As ``/var/log`` is already compressed by ZFS, logrotate’s compression is
   going to burn CPU and disk I/O for (in most cases) very little gain. Also,
   if you are making snapshots of ``/var/log``, logrotate’s compression will
   actually waste space, as the uncompressed data will live on in the
   snapshot. You can edit the files in ``/etc/logrotate.d`` by hand to comment
   out ``compress``, or use this loop (copy-and-paste highly recommended)::

     for file in /etc/logrotate.d/* ; do
         if grep -Eq "(^|[^#y])compress" "$file" ; then
             sed -i -r "s/(^|[^#y])(compress)/\1#\2/" "$file"
         fi
     done

#. Reboot::

     reboot

Step 9: Final Cleanup
---------------------

#. Wait for the system to boot normally. Login using the account you
   created. Ensure the system (including networking) works normally.

#. Optional: Delete the snapshots of the initial installation::

     sudo zfs destroy bpool/BOOT/debian@install
     sudo zfs destroy rpool/ROOT/debian@install

#. Optional: Disable the root password::

     sudo usermod -p '*' root

#. Optional (but highly recommended): Disable root SSH logins:

   If you installed SSH earlier, revert the temporary change::

     vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     # Remove: PermitRootLogin yes

     systemctl restart ssh

#. Optional: Re-enable the graphical boot process:

   If you prefer the graphical boot process, you can re-enable it now. If
   you are using LUKS, it makes the prompt look nicer.

   ::

     sudo vi /etc/default/grub
     # Add quiet to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT
     # Comment out GRUB_TERMINAL=console
     # Save and quit.

     sudo update-grub

   **Note:** Ignore errors from ``osprober``, if present.

#. Optional: For LUKS installs only, backup the LUKS header::

     sudo cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA_disk1-part4 \
         --header-backup-file luks1-header.dat

   Store that backup somewhere safe (e.g. cloud storage). It is protected by
   your LUKS passphrase, but you may wish to use additional encryption.

   **Hint:** If you created a mirror or raidz topology, repeat this for each
   LUKS volume (``luks2``, etc.).

Troubleshooting
---------------

Rescuing using a Live CD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go through `Step 1: Prepare The Install Environment
<#step-1-prepare-the-install-environment>`__.

For LUKS, first unlock the disk(s)::

  apt install --yes cryptsetup
  cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA_disk1-part4 luks1
  # Repeat for additional disks, if this is a mirror or raidz topology.

Mount everything correctly::

  zpool export -a
  zpool import -N -R /mnt rpool
  zpool import -N -R /mnt bpool
  zfs load-key -a
  zfs mount rpool/ROOT/debian
  zfs mount -a

If needed, you can chroot into your installed environment::

  mount --rbind /dev  /mnt/dev
  mount --rbind /proc /mnt/proc
  mount --rbind /sys  /mnt/sys
  chroot /mnt /bin/bash --login
  mount /boot
  mount -a

Do whatever you need to do to fix your system.

When done, cleanup::

  exit
  mount | grep -v zfs | tac | awk '/\/mnt/ {print $3}' | \
      xargs -i{} umount -lf {}
  zpool export -a
  reboot

Areca
~~~~~

Systems that require the ``arcsas`` blob driver should add it to the
``/etc/initramfs-tools/modules`` file and run ``update-initramfs -c -k all``.

Upgrade or downgrade the Areca driver if something like
``RIP: 0010:[<ffffffff8101b316>]  [<ffffffff8101b316>] native_read_tsc+0x6/0x20``
appears anywhere in kernel log. ZoL is unstable on systems that emit this
error message.

MPT2SAS
~~~~~~~

Most problem reports for this tutorial involve ``mpt2sas`` hardware that does
slow asynchronous drive initialization, like some IBM M1015 or OEM-branded
cards that have been flashed to the reference LSI firmware.

The basic problem is that disks on these controllers are not visible to the
Linux kernel until after the regular system is started, and ZoL does not
hotplug pool members. See `https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/issues/330
<https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/issues/330>`__.

Most LSI cards are perfectly compatible with ZoL. If your card has this
glitch, try setting ``ZFS_INITRD_PRE_MOUNTROOT_SLEEP=X`` in
``/etc/default/zfs``. The system will wait ``X`` seconds for all drives to
appear before importing the pool.

QEMU/KVM/XEN
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set a unique serial number on each virtual disk using libvirt or qemu
(e.g. ``-drive if=none,id=disk1,file=disk1.qcow2,serial=1234567890``).

To be able to use UEFI in guests (instead of only BIOS booting), run
this on the host::

  sudo apt install ovmf
  sudo vi /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf

Uncomment these lines:

.. code-block:: text

  nvram = [
     "/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd:/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_VARS.fd",
     "/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.secboot.fd:/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_VARS.fd",
     "/usr/share/AAVMF/AAVMF_CODE.fd:/usr/share/AAVMF/AAVMF_VARS.fd",
     "/usr/share/AAVMF/AAVMF32_CODE.fd:/usr/share/AAVMF/AAVMF32_VARS.fd"
  ]

::

  sudo systemctl restart libvirtd.service

VMware
~~~~~~

- Set ``disk.EnableUUID = "TRUE"`` in the vmx file or vsphere configuration.
  Doing this ensures that ``/dev/disk`` aliases are created in the guest.
