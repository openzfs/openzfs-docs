Installation on FreeBSD
-----------------------

OpenZFS is available pre-packaged as:

- the zfs-2.0-release branch, in the FreeBSD base system from FreeBSD 13.0-CURRENT forward
- the master branch, in the FreeBSD ports tree as sysutils/openzfs and sysutils/openzfs-kmod from FreeBSD 12.1 forward

The rest of this document describes the use of OpenZFS either from ports/pkg or built manually from sources for development.

The ZFS utilities will be installed in /usr/local/sbin/, so make sure
your PATH gets adjusted accordingly.

To load the module at boot, put ``openzfs_load="YES"`` in
/boot/loader.conf, and remove ``zfs_load="YES"`` if migrating a ZFS
install.

Beware that the FreeBSD boot loader does not allow booting from root
pools with encryption active (even if it is not in use), so do not try
encryption on a pool you boot from.

Development on FreeBSD
----------------------

The following dependencies are required to build OpenZFS on FreeBSD:

-  FreeBSD sources in /usr/src or elsewhere specified by SYSDIR in env.
   If you don't have the sources installed you can install them with
   svnlite.

   Install source For FreeBSD 12:
   ::

     svnlite checkout https://svn.freebsd.org/base/stable/12 /usr/src

   Install source for FreeBSD Current:
   ::

     svnlite checkout https://svn.freebsd.org/base/head /usr/src

-  Packages for build:
   ::

      pkg install \
          autoconf \
          automake \
          autotools \
          git \
          gmake \

-  Optional packages for build:
   ::

      pkg install python37 # or your preferred Python version
      pkg install py37-sysctl # needed for arcstat, arc_summary, dbufstat

-  Packages for checks and tests:
   ::

      pkg install \
          base64 \
          bash \
          checkbashisms \
          fio \
          hs-ShellCheck \
          ksh93 \
          pamtester \
          py37-flake8 \
          python37 \
          sudo

   Your preferred python version may be substituted. The user for
   running tests must have NOPASSWD sudo permission.

To build and install:

::

   # as user
   git clone https://github.com/openzfs/zfs
   cd zfs
   ./autogen.sh
   ./configure
   gmake -j`sysctl -n hw.ncpu`
   # as root
   gmake install

To use the OpenZFS kernel module when FreeBSD starts, edit ``/boot/loader.conf`` :

Replace the line:

::

  zfs_load="YES"

with:

::

  openzfs_load="YES"

The stock FreeBSD ZFS binaries are installed in /sbin.  OpenZFS binaries are installed to /usr/local/sbin when installed form ports/pkg or manually from the source.  To use OpenZFS binaries, adjust your path so /usr/local/sbin is listed before /sbin.  Otherwise the native ZFS binaries will be used.

For example, make changes to ~/.profile ~/.bashrc ~/.cshrc from this:

::

  PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:~/bin

To this:

::

  PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:~/bin

For rapid development it can be convenient to do a UFS install instead
of ZFS when setting up the work environment. That way the module can be
unloaded and loaded without rebooting.
::

	reboot

Though not required, ``WITHOUT_ZFS`` is a useful build option in FreeBSD
to avoid building and installing the legacy zfs tools and kmod - see
``src.conf(5)``.
