Caution
~~~~~~~

- This HOWTO uses a whole physical disk.
- Do not use these instructions for dual-booting.
- Backup your data. Any existing data will be lost.
- This is not an openSUSE official HOWTO page. This document will be updated if Root on ZFS support of
  openSUSE is added in the future.
  Also, `openSUSE's default system installer Yast2 does not support zfs <https://forums.opensuse.org/showthread.php/510071-HOWTO-Install-ZFSonLinux-on-OpenSuse>`__. The method of setting up system
  with zypper without Yast2 used in this page is based on openSUSE installation methods written by the
  experience of the people in the community.
  For more information about this, please look at the external links.


System Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


- `64-bit openSUSE Leap Live CD w/ GUI (e.g. gnome iso)
  <https://software.opensuse.org/distributions/leap>`__
- `A 64-bit kernel is strongly encouraged.
  <https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/wiki/FAQ#32-bit-vs-64-bit-systems>`__
- Installing on a drive which presents 4 KiB logical sectors (a “4Kn” drive)
  only works with UEFI booting. This not unique to ZFS. `GRUB does not and
  will not work on 4Kn with legacy (BIOS) booting.
  <http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?46700>`__

Computers that have less than 2 GiB of memory run ZFS slowly. 4 GiB of memory
is recommended for normal performance in basic workloads. If you wish to use
deduplication, you will need `massive amounts of RAM
<http://wiki.freebsd.org/ZFSTuningGuide#Deduplication>`__. Enabling
deduplication is a permanent change that cannot be easily reverted.

Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~

This guide supports three different encryption options: unencrypted, ZFS
native encryption, and LUKS. With any option, all ZFS features are fully
available.

Unencrypted does not encrypt anything, of course. With no encryption
happening, this option naturally has the best performance.

ZFS native encryption encrypts the data and most metadata in the root
pool. It does not encrypt dataset or snapshot names or properties. The
boot pool is not encrypted at all, but it only contains the bootloader,
kernel, and initrd. (Unless you put a password in ``/etc/fstab``, the
initrd is unlikely to contain sensitive data.) The system cannot boot
without the passphrase being entered at the console. Performance is
good. As the encryption happens in ZFS, even if multiple disks (mirror
or raidz topologies) are used, the data only has to be encrypted once.

LUKS encrypts almost everything. The only unencrypted data is the bootloader,
kernel, and initrd. The system cannot boot without the passphrase being
entered at the console. Performance is good, but LUKS sits underneath ZFS, so
if multiple disks (mirror or raidz topologies) are used, the data has to be
encrypted once per disk.

Step 1: Prepare The Install Environment
---------------------------------------

#. Boot the openSUSE Live CD. If prompted, login with the username
   ``live`` and password ``live``. Connect your system to the Internet as
   appropriate (e.g. join your WiFi network). Open a terminal.

#. Check your openSUSE Leap release::

    lsb-release -d
    Description:    openSUSE Leap {$release}

..note: This {$release} variable will affect your installation. Please make sure you have written your release data correctly in the repo url to avoid package dependency problem.

#. Setup and update the repositories::

     sudo zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/filesystems/openSUSE_Leap_{$release}/filesystems.repo
     sudo zypper refresh   # Refresh all repositories

#. Optional: Install and start the OpenSSH server in the Live CD environment:

   If you have a second system, using SSH to access the target system can be
   convenient::

     sudo zypper install openssh-server
     sudo systemctl restart sshd.service

   **Hint:** You can find your IP address with
   ``ip addr show scope global | grep inet``. Then, from your main machine,
   connect with ``ssh user@IP``.


#. Disable automounting:

   If the disk has been used before (with partitions at the same offsets),
   previous filesystems (e.g. the ESP) will automount if not disabled::

     gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.media-handling automount false


#. Become root::

     sudo -i

#. Install ZFS in the Live CD environment::

     zypper install zfs
     zypper install gdisk dkms
     modprobe zfs

Step 2: Disk Formatting
-----------------------

#. Set a variable with the disk name::

     DISK=/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA_disk1

   Always use the long ``/dev/disk/by-id/*`` aliases with ZFS. Using the
   ``/dev/sd*`` device nodes directly can cause sporadic import failures,
   especially on systems that have more than one storage pool.

   **Hints:**

   - ``ls -la /dev/disk/by-id`` will list the aliases.
   - Are you doing this in a virtual machine? If your virtual disk is missing
     from ``/dev/disk/by-id``, use ``/dev/vda`` if you are using KVM with
     virtio; otherwise, read the `troubleshooting <#troubleshooting>`__
     section.

#. If you are re-using a disk, clear it as necessary:

   If the disk was previously used in an MD array::

     zypper install mdadm

     # See if one or more MD arrays are active:
     cat /proc/mdstat
     # If so, stop them (replace ``md0`` as required):
     mdadm --stop /dev/md0

     # For an array using the whole disk:
     mdadm --zero-superblock --force $DISK
     # For an array using a partition:
     mdadm --zero-superblock --force ${DISK}-part2

   Clear the partition table::

     sgdisk --zap-all $DISK

   If you get a message about the kernel still using the old partition table,
   reboot and start over (except that you can skip this step).


#. Partition your disk(s):

   Run this if you need legacy (BIOS) booting::

     sgdisk -a1 -n1:24K:+1000K -t1:EF02 $DISK

   Run this for UEFI booting (for use now or in the future)::

     sgdisk     -n2:1M:+512M   -t2:EF00 $DISK

   Run this for the boot pool::

     sgdisk     -n3:0:+1G      -t3:BF01 $DISK

   Choose one of the following options:

   - Unencrypted or ZFS native encryption::

       sgdisk     -n4:0:0        -t4:BF00 $DISK

   - LUKS::

       sgdisk     -n4:0:0        -t4:8309 $DISK

   If you are creating a mirror or raidz topology, repeat the partitioning
   commands for all the disks which will be part of the pool.

#. Create the boot pool::

     zpool create \
         -o cachefile=/etc/zfs/zpool.cache \
         -o ashift=12 -d \
         -o feature@async_destroy=enabled \
         -o feature@bookmarks=enabled \
         -o feature@embedded_data=enabled \
         -o feature@empty_bpobj=enabled \
         -o feature@enabled_txg=enabled \
         -o feature@extensible_dataset=enabled \
         -o feature@filesystem_limits=enabled \
         -o feature@hole_birth=enabled \
         -o feature@large_blocks=enabled \
         -o feature@lz4_compress=enabled \
         -o feature@spacemap_histogram=enabled \
         -o feature@zpool_checkpoint=enabled \
         -O acltype=posixacl -O canmount=off -O compression=lz4 \
         -O devices=off -O normalization=formD -O relatime=on -O xattr=sa \
         -O mountpoint=/boot -R /mnt \
         bpool ${DISK}-part3

   You should not need to customize any of the options for the boot pool.

   GRUB does not support all of the zpool features. See ``spa_feature_names``
   in `grub-core/fs/zfs/zfs.c
   <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/grub.git/tree/grub-core/fs/zfs/zfs.c#n276>`__.
   This step creates a separate boot pool for ``/boot`` with the features
   limited to only those that GRUB supports, allowing the root pool to use
   any/all features. Note that GRUB opens the pool read-only, so all
   read-only compatible features are “supported” by GRUB.

   **Hints:**

   - If you are creating a mirror topology, create the pool using::

       zpool create \
           ... \
           bpool mirror \
           /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA_disk1-part3 \
           /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA_disk2-part3

   - For raidz topologies, replace ``mirror`` in the above command with
     ``raidz``, ``raidz2``, or  ``raidz3`` and list the partitions from
     additional disks.
   - The pool name is arbitrary. If changed, the new name must be used
     consistently. The ``bpool`` convention originated in this HOWTO.

   **Feature Notes:**

   - The ``allocation_classes`` feature should be safe to use. However, unless
     one is using it (i.e. a ``special`` vdev), there is no point to enabling
     it. It is extremely unlikely that someone would use this feature for a
     boot pool. If one cares about speeding up the boot pool, it would make
     more sense to put the whole pool on the faster disk rather than using it
     as a ``special`` vdev.
   - The ``project_quota`` feature has been tested and is safe to use. This
     feature is extremely unlikely to matter for the boot pool.
   - The ``resilver_defer`` should be safe but the boot pool is small enough
     that it is unlikely to be necessary.
   - The ``spacemap_v2`` feature has been tested and is safe to use. The boot
     pool is small, so this does not matter in practice.
   - As a read-only compatible feature, the ``userobj_accounting`` feature
     should be compatible in theory, but in practice, GRUB can fail with an
     “invalid dnode type” error. This feature does not matter for ``/boot``
     anyway.

#. Create the root pool:

   Choose one of the following options:

   - Unencrypted::

       zpool create \
           -o cachefile=/etc/zfs/zpool.cache \
           -o ashift=12 \
           -O acltype=posixacl -O canmount=off -O compression=lz4 \
           -O dnodesize=auto -O normalization=formD -O relatime=on \
           -O xattr=sa -O mountpoint=/ -R /mnt \
           rpool ${DISK}-part4

   - ZFS native encryption::

       zpool create \
           -o cachefile=/etc/zfs/zpool.cache \
           -o ashift=12 \
           -O encryption=aes-256-gcm \
           -O keylocation=prompt -O keyformat=passphrase \
           -O acltype=posixacl -O canmount=off -O compression=lz4 \
           -O dnodesize=auto -O normalization=formD -O relatime=on \
           -O xattr=sa -O mountpoint=/ -R /mnt \
           rpool ${DISK}-part4

   - LUKS::

       zypper install cryptsetup
       cryptsetup luksFormat -c aes-xts-plain64 -s 512 -h sha256 ${DISK}-part4
       cryptsetup luksOpen ${DISK}-part4 luks1
       zpool create \
           -o cachefile=/etc/zfs/zpool.cache \
           -o ashift=12 \
           -O acltype=posixacl -O canmount=off -O compression=lz4 \
           -O dnodesize=auto -O normalization=formD -O relatime=on \
           -O xattr=sa -O mountpoint=/ -R /mnt \
           rpool /dev/mapper/luks1

   **Notes:**

   - The use of ``ashift=12`` is recommended here because many drives
     today have 4 KiB (or larger) physical sectors, even though they
     present 512 B logical sectors. Also, a future replacement drive may
     have 4 KiB physical sectors (in which case ``ashift=12`` is desirable)
     or 4 KiB logical sectors (in which case ``ashift=12`` is required).
   - Setting ``-O acltype=posixacl`` enables POSIX ACLs globally. If you
     do not want this, remove that option, but later add
     ``-o acltype=posixacl`` (note: lowercase “o”) to the ``zfs create``
     for ``/var/log``, as `journald requires ACLs
     <https://askubuntu.com/questions/970886/journalctl-says-failed-to-search-journal-acl-operation-not-supported>`__
   - Setting ``normalization=formD`` eliminates some corner cases relating
     to UTF-8 filename normalization. It also implies ``utf8only=on``,
     which means that only UTF-8 filenames are allowed. If you care to
     support non-UTF-8 filenames, do not use this option. For a discussion
     of why requiring UTF-8 filenames may be a bad idea, see `The problems
     with enforced UTF-8 only filenames
     <http://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/ForcedUTF8Filenames>`__.
   - ``recordsize`` is unset (leaving it at the default of 128 KiB). If you
     want to tune it (e.g. ``-o recordsize=1M``), see `these
     <https://jrs-s.net/2019/04/03/on-zfs-recordsize/>`__ `various
     <http://blog.programster.org/zfs-record-size>`__ `blog
     <https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/solaris/ZFSFileRecordsizeGrowth>`__
     `posts
     <https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/solaris/ZFSRecordsizeAndCompression>`__.
   - Setting ``relatime=on`` is a middle ground between classic POSIX
     ``atime`` behavior (with its significant performance impact) and
     ``atime=off`` (which provides the best performance by completely
     disabling atime updates). Since Linux 2.6.30, ``relatime`` has been
     the default for other filesystems. See `RedHat’s documentation
     <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/power_management_guide/relatime>`__
     for further information.
   - Setting ``xattr=sa`` `vastly improves the performance of extended
     attributes
     <https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/commit/82a37189aac955c81a59a5ecc3400475adb56355>`__.
     Inside ZFS, extended attributes are used to implement POSIX ACLs.
     Extended attributes can also be used by user-space applications.
     `They are used by some desktop GUI applications.
     <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_file_attributes#Linux>`__
     `They can be used by Samba to store Windows ACLs and DOS attributes;
     they are required for a Samba Active Directory domain controller.
     <https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Setting_up_a_Share_Using_Windows_ACLs>`__
     Note that ``xattr=sa`` is `Linux-specific
     <https://openzfs.org/wiki/Platform_code_differences>`__. If you move your
     ``xattr=sa`` pool to another OpenZFS implementation besides ZFS-on-Linux,
     extended attributes will not be readable (though your data will be). If
     portability of extended attributes is important to you, omit the
     ``-O xattr=sa`` above. Even if you do not want ``xattr=sa`` for the whole
     pool, it is probably fine to use it for ``/var/log``.
   - Make sure to include the ``-part4`` portion of the drive path. If you
     forget that, you are specifying the whole disk, which ZFS will then
     re-partition, and you will lose the bootloader partition(s).
   - ZFS native encryption `now
     <https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/commit/31b160f0a6c673c8f926233af2ed6d5354808393>`__
     defaults to ``aes-256-gcm``.
   - For LUKS, the key size chosen is 512 bits. However, XTS mode requires two
     keys, so the LUKS key is split in half. Thus, ``-s 512`` means AES-256.
   - Your passphrase will likely be the weakest link. Choose wisely. See
     `section 5 of the cryptsetup FAQ
     <https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/wikis/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#5-security-aspects>`__
     for guidance.

   **Hints:**

   - If you are creating a mirror topology, create the pool using::

       zpool create \
           ... \
           rpool mirror \
           /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA_disk1-part4 \
           /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA_disk2-part4

   - For raidz topologies, replace ``mirror`` in the above command with
     ``raidz``, ``raidz2``, or  ``raidz3`` and list the partitions from
     additional disks.
   - When using LUKS with mirror or raidz topologies, use
     ``/dev/mapper/luks1``, ``/dev/mapper/luks2``, etc., which you will have
     to create using ``cryptsetup``.
   - The pool name is arbitrary. If changed, the new name must be used
     consistently. On systems that can automatically install to ZFS, the root
     pool is named ``rpool`` by default.

Step 3: System Installation
---------------------------

#. Create filesystem datasets to act as containers::

     zfs create -o canmount=off -o mountpoint=none rpool/ROOT
     zfs create -o canmount=off -o mountpoint=none bpool/BOOT

   On Solaris systems, the root filesystem is cloned and the suffix is
   incremented for major system changes through ``pkg image-update`` or
   ``beadm``. Similar functionality has been implemented in Ubuntu 20.04 with
   the ``zsys`` tool, though its dataset layout is more complicated. Even
   without such a tool, the `rpool/ROOT` and `bpool/BOOT` containers can still
   be used for manually created clones. That said, this HOWTO assumes a single
   filesystem for ``/boot`` for simplicity.

#. Create filesystem datasets for the root and boot filesystems::

     zfs create -o canmount=noauto -o mountpoint=/ rpool/ROOT/suse
     zfs mount rpool/ROOT/suse

     zfs create -o mountpoint=/boot bpool/BOOT/suse

   With ZFS, it is not normally necessary to use a mount command (either
   ``mount`` or ``zfs mount``). This situation is an exception because of
   ``canmount=noauto``.

#. Create datasets::

     zfs create                                 rpool/home
     zfs create -o mountpoint=/root             rpool/home/root
     chmod 700 /mnt/root
     zfs create -o canmount=off                 rpool/var
     zfs create -o canmount=off                 rpool/var/lib
     zfs create                                 rpool/var/log
     zfs create                                 rpool/var/spool

   The datasets below are optional, depending on your preferences and/or
   software choices.

   If you wish to exclude these from snapshots::

     zfs create -o com.sun:auto-snapshot=false  rpool/var/cache
     zfs create -o com.sun:auto-snapshot=false  rpool/var/tmp
     chmod 1777 /mnt/var/tmp

   If you use /opt on this system::

     zfs create                                 rpool/opt

   If you use /srv on this system::

     zfs create                                 rpool/srv

   If you use /usr/local on this system::

     zfs create -o canmount=off                 rpool/usr
     zfs create                                 rpool/usr/local

   If this system will have games installed::

     zfs create                                 rpool/var/games

   If this system will store local email in /var/mail::

     zfs create                                 rpool/var/mail

   If this system will use Snap packages::

     zfs create                                 rpool/var/snap

   If this system will use Flatpak packages::

     zfs create                                 rpool/var/lib/flatpak

   If you use /var/www on this system::

     zfs create                                 rpool/var/www

   If this system will use GNOME::

     zfs create                                 rpool/var/lib/AccountsService

   If this system will use Docker (which manages its own datasets &
   snapshots)::

     zfs create -o com.sun:auto-snapshot=false  rpool/var/lib/docker

   If this system will use NFS (locking)::

     zfs create -o com.sun:auto-snapshot=false  rpool/var/lib/nfs


   Mount a tmpfs at /run::

     mkdir /mnt/run
     mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /mnt/run
     mkdir /mnt/run/lock


   A tmpfs is recommended later, but if you want a separate dataset for
   ``/tmp``::

     zfs create -o com.sun:auto-snapshot=false  rpool/tmp
     chmod 1777 /mnt/tmp

   The primary goal of this dataset layout is to separate the OS from user
   data. This allows the root filesystem to be rolled back without rolling
   back user data.

   If you do nothing extra, ``/tmp`` will be stored as part of the root
   filesystem. Alternatively, you can create a separate dataset for ``/tmp``,
   as shown above. This keeps the ``/tmp`` data out of snapshots of your root
   filesystem. It also allows you to set a quota on ``rpool/tmp``, if you want
   to limit the maximum space used. Otherwise, you can use a tmpfs (RAM
   filesystem) later.


#. Copy in zpool.cache::

     mkdir /mnt/etc/zfs -p
     cp /etc/zfs/zpool.cache /mnt/etc/zfs/

Step 4. Install System
----------------------

#. Add repositories into chrooting directory::

     zypper --root /mnt ar http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/leap/{$release}/repo/non-os  non-os
     zypper --root /mnt ar http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/leap/{$release}/repo/os os
     zypper --root /mnt ar http://download.opensuse.org/update/leap/{$release}/oss  update-oss
     zypper --root /mnt ar http://download.opensuse.org/update/leap/{$release}/non-oss update-nonos

#. Generate repository indexes::

     zypper --root /mnt refresh


   You will get fingerprint exception, click a to say always trust and continue.::

     New repository or package signing key received:

     Repository:       oss

#. Install openSUSE Leap with zypper:

   If you install `base` pattern, zypper will install `busybox-grep` which is masks default kernel package.
   Thats why I recommend you to install `enhanced_base` pattern, if you're new in openSUSE. But in `enhanced_base`, bloats
   can annoy you, while you want to use it openSUSE on server. So, you need to select

   a. Install base packages of openSUSE Leap with zypper (Recommended for server)::

       zypper --root /mnt install -t pattern base


   b. Install enhanced base of openSUSE Leap with zypper (Recommended for desktop)::

       zypper --root /mnt install -t pattern enhanced_base



#. Install openSUSE zypper package system into chroot::

     zypper --root /mnt install zypper

#. Recommended: Install openSUSE yast2 system into chroot::

     zypper --root /mnt install yast2

  It will make easier to configure network and other configurations for beginners.



To install a desktop environment, see the `openSUSE wiki
<https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Desktop_FAQ#How_to_choose_a_desktop_environment.3F>`__

Step 5: System Configuration
----------------------------

#. Configure the hostname:

   Replace ``HOSTNAME`` with the desired hostname::

     echo HOSTNAME > /mnt/etc/hostname
     vi /mnt/etc/hosts

   Add a line:

   .. code-block:: text

     127.0.1.1       HOSTNAME

   or if the system has a real name in DNS:

   .. code-block:: text

     127.0.1.1       FQDN HOSTNAME

   **Hint:** Use ``nano`` if you find ``vi`` confusing.

#. Copy network information::

     cp /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc

   You will reconfigure network with yast2.

#. Bind the virtual filesystems from the LiveCD environment to the new
   system and ``chroot`` into it::

     mount --rbind /dev  /mnt/dev
     mount --rbind /proc /mnt/proc
     mount --rbind /sys  /mnt/sys
     mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /mnt/run
     mkdir /mnt/run/lock

     chroot /mnt /usr/bin/env DISK=$DISK bash --login

   **Note:** This is using ``--rbind``, not ``--bind``.

#. Configure a basic system environment::

     ln -s /proc/self/mounts /etc/mtab
     zypper refresh

   Even if you prefer a non-English system language, always ensure that
   ``en_US.UTF-8`` is available::

     locale -a

   Output must include that languages:

   * C
   * C.UTF-8
   * en_US.utf8
   * POSIX

   Find yout locale from `locale -a` commands output then set it with following command.

   .. code-block:: text

     localectl set-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8


#. Optional: Reinstallation for stability:

   After installation it may need. Some packages may have minor errors.
   For that, do this if you wish. Since there is no command like
   dpkg-reconfigure in openSUSE,  `zypper install -f stated as a alternative for
   it <https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2009-07/msg00188.html>`__
   but it will reinstall packages.

   .. code-block:: text

     zypper install -f permissions-config iputils ca-certificates  ca-certificates-mozilla pam shadow dbus libutempter0 suse-module-tools util-linux


#. Install kernel::

     zypper install kernel-default kernel-firmware

   .. note:: If you installed `base` pattern, you need to deinstall busybox-grep to install `kernel-default` package.

#. Install ZFS in the chroot environment for the new system::

     zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/filesystems/openSUSE_Leap_{$release}/filesystems.repo
     zypper refresh   # Refresh all repositories
     zypper install zfs

#. For LUKS installs only, setup ``/etc/crypttab``::

     zypper install cryptsetup

     echo luks1 /dev/disk/by-uuid/$(blkid -s UUID -o value ${DISK}-part4) none \
         luks,discard,initramfs > /etc/crypttab

   The use of ``initramfs`` is a work-around for `cryptsetup does not support
   ZFS <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cryptsetup/+bug/1612906>`__.

   **Hint:** If you are creating a mirror or raidz topology, repeat the
   ``/etc/crypttab`` entries for ``luks2``, etc. adjusting for each disk.

#. For LUKS installs only, fix cryptsetup naming for ZFS::

     echo 'ENV{DM_NAME}!="", SYMLINK+="$env{DM_NAME}"
     ENV{DM_NAME}!="", SYMLINK+="dm-name-$env{DM_NAME}"' >> /etc/udev/rules.d/99-local-crypt.rules


#. Install GRUB

   Choose one of the following options:

   - Install GRUB for legacy (BIOS) booting::

       zypper install grub2-x86_64-pc

     If your processor is 32bit use `grub2-i386-pc` instead of x86_64 one.

   - Install GRUB for UEFI booting::

       zypper install grub2-x86_64-efi dosfstools os-prober
       mkdosfs -F 32 -s 1 -n EFI ${DISK}-part2
       mkdir /boot/efi
       echo /dev/disk/by-uuid/$(blkid -s PARTUUID -o value ${DISK}-part2) \
           /boot/efi vfat defaults 0 0 >> /etc/fstab
       mount /boot/efi

     **Notes:**

     - The ``-s 1`` for ``mkdosfs`` is only necessary for drives which present
        4 KiB logical sectors (“4Kn” drives) to meet the minimum cluster size
        (given the partition size of 512 MiB) for FAT32. It also works fine on
        drives which present 512 B sectors.
     - For a mirror or raidz topology, this step only installs GRUB on the
        first disk. The other disk(s) will be handled later.

#. Optional: Remove os-prober::

     zypper remove os-prober

   This avoids error messages from `update-bootloader`. `os-prober` is only
   necessary in dual-boot configurations.

#. Set a root password::

     passwd

#. Enable importing bpool

   This ensures that ``bpool`` is always imported, regardless of whether
   ``/etc/zfs/zpool.cache`` exists, whether it is in the cachefile or not,
   or whether ``zfs-import-scan.service`` is enabled.

   ::

         vi /etc/systemd/system/zfs-import-bpool.service

   .. code-block:: ini

         [Unit]
         DefaultDependencies=no
         Before=zfs-import-scan.service
         Before=zfs-import-cache.service

         [Service]
         Type=oneshot
         RemainAfterExit=yes
         ExecStart=/sbin/zpool import -N -o cachefile=none bpool
         # Work-around to preserve zpool cache:
         ExecStartPre=-/bin/mv /etc/zfs/zpool.cache /etc/zfs/preboot_zpool.cache
         ExecStartPost=-/bin/mv /etc/zfs/preboot_zpool.cache /etc/zfs/zpool.cache

         [Install]
         WantedBy=zfs-import.target

   ::

     systemctl enable zfs-import-bpool.service

#. Optional (but recommended): Mount a tmpfs to ``/tmp``

   If you chose to create a ``/tmp`` dataset above, skip this step, as they
   are mutually exclusive choices. Otherwise, you can put ``/tmp`` on a
   tmpfs (RAM filesystem) by enabling the ``tmp.mount`` unit.

   ::

     cp /usr/share/systemd/tmp.mount /etc/systemd/system/
     systemctl enable tmp.mount


Step 6: Kernel Installation
---------------------------

#. Add zfs module into dracut::

     echo 'zfs'>> /etc/modules-load.d/zfs.conf


#. Refresh kernel files::

     kernel-install add $(uname -r) /boot/vmlinuz-$(uname -r)

#. Refresh the initrd files::

     mkinitrd

   **Note:** After some installations, LUKS partition cannot seen by dracut,
   this will print “Failure occured during following action:
   configuring encrypted DM device X VOLUME_CRYPTSETUP_FAILED“. For fix this
   issue you need to check cryptsetup installation. `See for more information <https://forums.opensuse.org/showthread.php/528938-installation-with-LUKS-cryptsetup-installer-gives-error-code-3034?p=2850404#post2850404>`__
   **Note:** Although we add the zfs config to the system module into `/etc/modules.d`, if it is not seen by dracut, we have to add it to dracut by force.
   `dracut --kver $(uname -r) --force --add-drivers "zfs"`


Step 7: Grub2 Installation
--------------------------

#. Verify that the ZFS boot filesystem is recognized::

     grub2-probe /boot

   Output must be `zfs`

#. If you having trouble with `grub2-probe` command make this::

     echo 'export ZPOOL_VDEV_NAME_PATH=YES' >> /etc/profile
     export ZPOOL_VDEV_NAME_PATH=YES

   then go back to `grub2-probe` step.


#. Workaround GRUB's missing zpool-features support::

     vi /etc/default/grub
     # Set: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="root=ZFS=rpool/ROOT/suse"

#. Optional (but highly recommended): Make debugging GRUB easier::

     vi /etc/default/grub
     # Remove quiet from: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT
     # Uncomment: GRUB_TERMINAL=console
     # Save and quit.

   Later, once the system has rebooted twice and you are sure everything is
   working, you can undo these changes, if desired.

#. Update the boot configuration::

     update-bootloader

   **Note:** Ignore errors from ``osprober``, if present.
   **Note:** If you have had trouble with the grub2 installation, I suggest you use systemd-boot.
   **Note:** If this command don't gives any output, use classic grub.cfg generation with following command:
   ``grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg``

#. Install the boot loader:

   #. For legacy (BIOS) booting, install GRUB to the MBR::

        grub2-install $DISK

   Note that you are installing GRUB to the whole disk, not a partition.

   If you are creating a mirror or raidz topology, repeat the ``grub-install``
   command for each disk in the pool.

   #. For UEFI booting, install GRUB to the ESP::

        grub2-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi \
            --bootloader-id=opensuse --recheck --no-floppy

      It is not necessary to specify the disk here. If you are creating a
      mirror or raidz topology, the additional disks will be handled later.

Step 8: Systemd-Boot Installation
---------------------------------

**Warning:** This will break your Yast2 Bootloader Configuration. Make sure that you
are not able to fix the problem you are having with grub2. I decided to write this
part because sometimes grub2 doesn't see the rpool pool in some cases.

#. Install systemd-boot::

     bootctl install

#. Configure bootloader configuration::

     tee -a /boot/efi/loader/loader.conf << EOF
     default openSUSE_Leap.conf
     timeout 5
     console-mode auto
     EOF

#. Write Entries::

     tee -a /boot/efi/loader/entries/openSUSE_Leap.conf << EOF
     title   openSUSE Leap
     linux   /EFI/openSUSE/vmlinuz
     initrd  /EFI/openSUSE/initrd
     options root=zfs=rpool/ROOT/suse boot=zfs
     EOF

#. Copy files into EFI::

     mkdir /boot/efi/EFI/openSUSE
     cp /boot/{vmlinuz,initrd} /boot/efi/EFI/openSUSE

#. Update systemd-boot variables::

     bootctl update

Step 9: Filesystem Configuration
--------------------------------

#. Fix filesystem mount ordering:

   We need to activate ``zfs-mount-generator``. This makes systemd aware of
   the separate mountpoints, which is important for things like ``/var/log``
   and ``/var/tmp``. In turn, ``rsyslog.service`` depends on ``var-log.mount``
   by way of ``local-fs.target`` and services using the ``PrivateTmp`` feature
   of systemd automatically use ``After=var-tmp.mount``.

   ::

     mkdir /etc/zfs/zfs-list.cache
     touch /etc/zfs/zfs-list.cache/bpool
     touch /etc/zfs/zfs-list.cache/rpool
     ln -s /usr/lib/zfs/zed.d/history_event-zfs-list-cacher.sh /etc/zfs/zed.d
     zed -F &

   Verify that ``zed`` updated the cache by making sure these are not empty::

     cat /etc/zfs/zfs-list.cache/bpool
     cat /etc/zfs/zfs-list.cache/rpool

   If either is empty, force a cache update and check again::

     zfs set canmount=on     bpool/BOOT/suse
     zfs set canmount=noauto rpool/ROOT/suse

   If they are still empty, stop zed (as below), start zed (as above) and try
   again.

   Stop ``zed``::

     fg
     Press Ctrl-C.

   Fix the paths to eliminate ``/mnt``::

     sed -Ei "s|/mnt/?|/|" /etc/zfs/zfs-list.cache/*

Step 10: First Boot
-------------------

#. Optional: Install SSH::

     zypper install --yes openssh-server

     vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     # Set: PermitRootLogin yes

#. Optional: Snapshot the initial installation::

     zfs snapshot bpool/BOOT/suse@install
     zfs snapshot rpool/ROOT/suse@install

   In the future, you will likely want to take snapshots before each
   upgrade, and remove old snapshots (including this one) at some point to
   save space.

#. Exit from the ``chroot`` environment back to the LiveCD environment::

     exit

#. Run these commands in the LiveCD environment to unmount all
   filesystems::

     mount | grep -v zfs | tac | awk '/\/mnt/ {print $3}' | \
         xargs -i{} umount -lf {}
     zpool export -a

#. Reboot::

     reboot

   Wait for the newly installed system to boot normally. Login as root.

#. Create a user account:

   Replace ``username`` with your desired username::

     zfs create rpool/home/username
     adduser username

     cp -a /etc/skel/. /home/username
     chown -R username:username /home/username
     usermod -a -G audio,cdrom,dip,floppy,netdev,plugdev,sudo,video username

#. Mirror GRUB

   If you installed to multiple disks, install GRUB on the additional
   disks.

   - For legacy (BIOS) booting::
     Check to be sure we using efi mode:

     .. code-block:: text

         efibootmgr -v

     This must return a message contains `legacy_boot`

     Then reconfigure grub:

     .. code-block:: text

         grub-install $DISK

     Hit enter until you get to the device selection screen.
     Select (using the space bar) all of the disks (not partitions) in your pool.

   - For UEFI booting::

       umount /boot/efi

     For the second and subsequent disks (increment debian-2 to -3, etc.)::

       dd if=/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA_disk1-part2 \
          of=/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA_disk2-part2
       efibootmgr -c -g -d /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA_disk2 \
           -p 2 -L "opensuse-2" -l '\EFI\opensuse\grubx64.efi'

       mount /boot/efi

Step 11: Optional: Configure Swap
---------------------------------

**Caution**: On systems with extremely high memory pressure, using a
zvol for swap can result in lockup, regardless of how much swap is still
available. There is `a bug report upstream
<https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/issues/7734>`__.

#. Create a volume dataset (zvol) for use as a swap device::

     zfs create -V 4G -b $(getconf PAGESIZE) -o compression=zle \
         -o logbias=throughput -o sync=always \
         -o primarycache=metadata -o secondarycache=none \
         -o com.sun:auto-snapshot=false rpool/swap

   You can adjust the size (the ``4G`` part) to your needs.

   The compression algorithm is set to ``zle`` because it is the cheapest
   available algorithm. As this guide recommends ``ashift=12`` (4 kiB
   blocks on disk), the common case of a 4 kiB page size means that no
   compression algorithm can reduce I/O. The exception is all-zero pages,
   which are dropped by ZFS; but some form of compression has to be enabled
   to get this behavior.

#. Configure the swap device:

   **Caution**: Always use long ``/dev/zvol`` aliases in configuration
   files. Never use a short ``/dev/zdX`` device name.

   ::

     mkswap -f /dev/zvol/rpool/swap
     echo /dev/zvol/rpool/swap none swap discard 0 0 >> /etc/fstab
     echo RESUME=none > /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume

   The ``RESUME=none`` is necessary to disable resuming from hibernation.
   This does not work, as the zvol is not present (because the pool has not
   yet been imported) at the time the resume script runs. If it is not
   disabled, the boot process hangs for 30 seconds waiting for the swap
   zvol to appear.

#. Enable the swap device::

     swapon -av

Step 12: Final Cleanup
----------------------

#. Wait for the system to boot normally. Login using the account you
   created. Ensure the system (including networking) works normally.

#. Optional: Delete the snapshots of the initial installation::

     sudo zfs destroy bpool/BOOT/suse@install
     sudo zfs destroy rpool/ROOT/suse@install

#. Optional: Disable the root password::

     sudo usermod -p '*' root

#. Optional (but highly recommended): Disable root SSH logins:

   If you installed SSH earlier, revert the temporary change::

     vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     # Remove: PermitRootLogin yes

     systemctl restart sshd

#. Optional: Re-enable the graphical boot process:

   If you prefer the graphical boot process, you can re-enable it now. If
   you are using LUKS, it makes the prompt look nicer.

   ::

     sudo vi /etc/default/grub
     # Add quiet to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT
     # Comment out GRUB_TERMINAL=console
     # Save and quit.

     sudo update-bootloader

   **Note:** Ignore errors from ``osprober``, if present.

#. Optional: For LUKS installs only, backup the LUKS header::

     sudo cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA_disk1-part4 \
         --header-backup-file luks1-header.dat

   Store that backup somewhere safe (e.g. cloud storage). It is protected by
   your LUKS passphrase, but you may wish to use additional encryption.

   **Hint:** If you created a mirror or raidz topology, repeat this for each
   LUKS volume (``luks2``, etc.).

Troubleshooting
---------------

Rescuing using a Live CD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go through `Step 1: Prepare The Install Environment
<#step-1-prepare-the-install-environment>`__.

For LUKS, first unlock the disk(s)::

  zypper install cryptsetup
  cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA_disk1-part4 luks1
  # Repeat for additional disks, if this is a mirror or raidz topology.

Mount everything correctly::

  zpool export -a
  zpool import -N -R /mnt rpool
  zpool import -N -R /mnt bpool
  zfs load-key -a
  zfs mount rpool/ROOT/suse
  zfs mount -a

If needed, you can chroot into your installed environment::

  mount --rbind /dev  /mnt/dev
  mount --rbind /proc /mnt/proc
  mount --rbind /sys  /mnt/sys
  chroot /mnt /bin/bash --login
  mount /boot
  mount -a

Do whatever you need to do to fix your system.

When done, cleanup::

  exit
  mount | grep -v zfs | tac | awk '/\/mnt/ {print $3}' | \
      xargs -i{} umount -lf {}
  zpool export -a
  reboot

Areca
~~~~~

Systems that require the ``arcsas`` blob driver should add it to the
``/etc/initramfs-tools/modules`` file and run ``update-initramfs -c -k all``.

Upgrade or downgrade the Areca driver if something like
``RIP: 0010:[<ffffffff8101b316>]  [<ffffffff8101b316>] native_read_tsc+0x6/0x20``
appears anywhere in kernel log. ZoL is unstable on systems that emit this
error message.

MPT2SAS
~~~~~~~

Most problem reports for this tutorial involve ``mpt2sas`` hardware that does
slow asynchronous drive initialization, like some IBM M1015 or OEM-branded
cards that have been flashed to the reference LSI firmware.

The basic problem is that disks on these controllers are not visible to the
Linux kernel until after the regular system is started, and ZoL does not
hotplug pool members. See `https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/issues/330
<https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/issues/330>`__.

Most LSI cards are perfectly compatible with ZoL. If your card has this
glitch, try setting ``ZFS_INITRD_PRE_MOUNTROOT_SLEEP=X`` in
``/etc/default/zfs``. The system will wait ``X`` seconds for all drives to
appear before importing the pool.

QEMU/KVM/XEN
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set a unique serial number on each virtual disk using libvirt or qemu
(e.g. ``-drive if=none,id=disk1,file=disk1.qcow2,serial=1234567890``).

To be able to use UEFI in guests (instead of only BIOS booting), run
this on the host::

  sudo zypper install ovmf
  sudo vi /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf

Uncomment these lines:

.. code-block:: text

  nvram = [
     "/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd:/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_VARS.fd",
     "/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.secboot.fd:/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_VARS.fd",
     "/usr/share/AAVMF/AAVMF_CODE.fd:/usr/share/AAVMF/AAVMF_VARS.fd",
     "/usr/share/AAVMF/AAVMF32_CODE.fd:/usr/share/AAVMF/AAVMF32_VARS.fd"
  ]

::

  sudo systemctl restart libvirtd.service

VMware
~~~~~~

- Set ``disk.EnableUUID = "TRUE"`` in the vmx file or vsphere configuration.
  Doing this ensures that ``/dev/disk`` aliases are created in the guest.
