=====

.. note::
   This page a describes functionality which has been merged to the
   master branch but is not in the OpenZFS 2.0 release.  In order to
   use dRAID you'll need to checkout the latest source and build
   `custom packages`_ to install.

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

`dRAID`_ is a variant of raidz that provides integrated distributed hot
spares which allows for faster resilvering while retaining the benefits
of raidz.  A dRAID vdev is constructed from multiple internal raidz
groups, each with D data devices and P parity devices.  These groups
are distributed over all of the children in order to fully utilize the
available disk performance.  This is known as parity declustering and
it has been an active area of research.  The image below is simplified,
but it helps illustrate this key difference between dRAID and raidz.

Additionally, a dRAID vdev must shuffle its child vdevs in such a way
that regardless of which drive has failed, the rebuild IO (both read
and write) will distribute evenly among all surviving drives.  This
is accomplished by using carefully chosen precomputed permutation
maps.  This has the advantage of both keeping pool creation fast and
making it impossible for the mapping to be damaged or lost.

Another way dRAID differs from raidz is that it uses a fixed stripe
width (padding as necessary with zeros).  This allows a dRAID vdev to
be sequentially resilvered, however the fixed stripe width significantly
effects both usable capacity and IOPS.  For example, with the default
D=8 and 4k disk sectors the minimum allocation size is 32k.  If using
compression, this relatively large allocation size can reduce the
effective compression ratio.  When using ZFS volumes and dRAID the
default volblocksize property is increased to account for the allocation
size.  If a dRAID pool will hold a significant amount of small blocks,
it is recommended to also add a mirrored special vdev to store those
blocks.

In regards to IO/s, performance is similar to raidz since for any
read all D data disks must be accessed.  Delivered random IOPS can be
reasonably approximated as floor((N-S)/(D+P))*<single-drive-IOPS>.

In summary dRAID can provide the same level of redundancy and
performance as raidz, while also providing a fast integrated distributed
spare.

Create a dRAID vdev
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A dRAID vdev is created like any other by using the ``zpool create``
command and enumerating the disks which should be used.

::

   # zpool create <pool> draid[1,2,3] <vdevs...>

Like raidz, the parity level is specified immediately after the ``draid``
vdev type.  However, unlike raidz additional colon separated options can be
specified.  The most important of which is the ``:<spares>s`` option which
controls the number of distributed hot spares to create.  By default, no
spares are created.  The ``:<data>d`` option can be specified to set the
number of data devices to use in each RAID stripe (D+P).  When unspecified
reasonable defaults are chosen.

::

   # zpool create <pool> draid[<parity>][:<data>d][:<children>c][:<spares>s] <vdevs...>

- **parity** - The parity level (1-3).  Defaults to one.

- **data** - The number of data devices per redundancy group.  In general
  a smaller value of D will increase IOPS, improve the compression ratio,
  and speed up resilvering at the expense of total usable capacity.
  Defaults to 8, unless N-P-S is less than 8.

- **children** - The expected number of children.  Useful as a cross-check
  when listing a large number of devices.  An error is returned when the
  provided number of children differs.

- **spares** - The number of distributed hot spares.  Defaults to zero.

For example, to create an 11 disk dRAID pool with 4+1 redundancy and a
single distributed spare the command would be:

::

   # zpool create tank draid:4d:1s:11c /dev/sd[a-k]
   # zpool status tank

     pool: tank
    state: ONLINE
   config:

           NAME                  STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
           tank                  ONLINE       0     0     0
             draid1:4d:11c:1s-0  ONLINE       0     0     0
               sda               ONLINE       0     0     0
               sdb               ONLINE       0     0     0
               sdc               ONLINE       0     0     0
               sdd               ONLINE       0     0     0
               sde               ONLINE       0     0     0
               sdf               ONLINE       0     0     0
               sdg               ONLINE       0     0     0
               sdh               ONLINE       0     0     0
               sdi               ONLINE       0     0     0
               sdj               ONLINE       0     0     0

           spares
             draid1-0-0          AVAIL

Note that the dRAID vdev name, ``draid1:4d:11c:1s``, fully describes the
configuration and all of disks which are part of the dRAID are listed.
Furthermore, the logical distributed hot spare is shown as an available
spare disk.

Rebuilding to a Distributed Spare
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the major advantages of dRAID is that it supports both sequential
and traditional healing resilvers.  When performing a sequential resilver
to a distributed hot spare the performance scales with the number of disks
divided by the stripe width (D+P).  This can greatly reduce resilver times
and restore full redundancy in a fraction of the usual time.  For example,
the following graph shows the observed sequential resilver time in hours
for a 90 HDD based dRAID filled to 90% capacity.

|draid-resilver|

When using dRAID and a distributed spare, the process for handling a
failed disk is almost identical to raidz with a traditional hot spare.
When a disk failure is detected the ZFS Event Daemon (ZED) will start
rebuilding to a spare if one is available.  The only difference is that
for dRAID a sequential resilver is started, while a healing resilver must
be used for raidz.

While both types of resilvering achieve the same goal it's worth taking
a moment to summarize the key differences.

- A traditional healing resilver scans the entire block tree.  This
  means the checksum for each block is available while it's being
  repaired and can be immediately verified.  The downside is this
  creates a random read workload which is not ideal for performance.

- A sequential resilver instead scans the space maps in order to
  determine what space is allocated and what must be repaired.
  This rebuild process is not limited to block boundaries and can
  sequentially reads from the disks and make repairs using larger
  I/Os.  The price to pay for this performance improvement is that
  the block checksums cannot be verified while resilvering.  Therefore,
  a scrub is started to verify the checksums after the sequential
  resilver completes.

For a more in depth explanation of the differences between sequential
and healing resilvering check out these `sequential resilver`_ slides
which were presented at the OpenZFS Developer Summit.

Rebalancing
~~~~~~~~~~~

Distributed spare space can be made available again by simply replacing
any failed drive with a new drive. This process is called rebalancing
and is essentially a resilver.  When performing rebalancing a healing
resilver is recommended since the pool is no longer degraded.  This
ensures all checksums are verified when rebuilding to the new disk
and eliminates the need to perform a subsequent scrub of the pool.
