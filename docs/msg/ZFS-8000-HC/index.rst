ZFS pool I/O failures

+-------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| **Description:**        | The ZFS pool has experienced currently  |
|                         | unrecoverable I/O failures.             |
+-------------------------+-----------------------------------------+

+-------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| **Impact:**             | Read and write I/Os cannot be serviced. |
+-------------------------+-----------------------------------------+

.. rubric:: Suggested Action for System Administrator

The pool has experienced I/O failures.  Since the ZFS pool property
``failmode`` is set to 'wait', all I/Os (reads and writes) are blocked.
See the zpoolprops(8) manpage for more information on the ``failmode``
property.  Manual intervention is required for I/Os to be serviced.

You can see which devices are affected by running ``zpool status -x``:

::

   # zpool status -x
     pool: test
    state: FAULTED
   status: There are I/O failures.
   action: Make sure the affected devices are connected, then run 'zpool clear'.
      see: https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/msg/ZFS-8000-HC
    scrub: none requested
   config:

           NAME        STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
           test        FAULTED      0    13     0  insufficient replicas
             c0t0d0    FAULTED      0     7     0  experienced I/O failures
             c0t1d0    ONLINE       0     0     0

   errors: 1 data errors, use '-v' for a list

After you have made sure the affected devices are connected, run ``zpool
clear`` to allow I/O to the pool again:

::

   # zpool clear test

If I/O failures continue to happen, then applications and commands for the pool
may hang.  At this point, a reboot may be necessary to allow I/O to the pool
again.
