Accept a PR
===========

After a PR is generated, it is available to be commented upon by project
members. They may request additional changes, please work with them.

In addition, project members may accept PRs; this is not an automatic
process. By convention, PRs aren't accepted for at least a day, to allow
all members a chance to comment.

After a PR has been accepted, it is available to be merged.
