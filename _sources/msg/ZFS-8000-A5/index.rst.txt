   # zpool status -x
     pool: test
    state: FAULTED
   status: The ZFS version for the pool is incompatible with the software running
           on this system.

The pool cannot be used on this system.  Either move the storage to
the system where the pool was originally created, upgrade the current
system software to a more recent version, or destroy the pool and
re-create it from backup.

If this error is seen during import, the pool cannot be imported on
the current system.  The disks must be attached to the system which
originally created the pool, and imported there.

The list of currently supported versions can be displayed using
``zpool upgrade -v``.
