.. rubric:: Suggested Action for System Administrator

The pool has been written to from another host, and was not cleanly
exported from the other system.  Actively importing a pool on multiple
systems will corrupt the pool and leave it in an unrecoverable state.
To determine which system last accessed the pool, run the ``zpool
import`` command:

::

   # zpool import
     pool: test
       id: 14702934086626715962
    state: ONLINE
   status: The pool was last accessed by another system.
   action: The pool can be imported using its name or numeric identifier and
           the '-f' flag.
      see: https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/msg/ZFS-8000-EY
   config:

           test              ONLINE
             c0t0d0          ONLINE

   # zpool import test
   cannot import 'test': pool may be in use from other system, it was last
   accessed by 'tank' (hostid: 0x1435718c) on Fri Mar  9 15:42:47 2007
   use '-f' to import anyway

If you are certain that the pool is not being actively accessed by
another system, then you can use the ``-f`` option to ``zpool import`` to
forcibly import the pool.

.. rubric:: Details

The Message ID: ``ZFS-8000-EY`` indicates that the pool cannot be
imported as it was last accessed by another system.  Take the
documented action to resolve the problem.
