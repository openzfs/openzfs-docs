.. rubric:: Suggested Action for System Administrator

Run ``zpool status -x`` to determine which pool is damaged:

::

   # zpool status -x
     pool: test
    state: ONLINE
   status: One or more devices has experienced an error and no valid replicas
           are available.  Some filesystem data is corrupt, and applications
           may have been affected.
   action: Destroy the pool and restore from backup.
      see: https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/msg/ZFS-8000-8A
    scrub: none requested
   config:

           NAME                  STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
           test                  ONLINE       0     0     2
             c0t0d0              ONLINE       0     0     2
             c0t0d1              ONLINE       0     0     0

   errors: 1 data errors, use '-v' for a list

Unfortunately, the data cannot be repaired, and the only choice to
repair the data is to restore the pool from backup.  Applications
attempting to access the corrupted data will get an error (EIO), and
data may be permanently lost.

The list of affected files can be retrieved by using the ``-v`` option to
``zpool status``:

::

   # zpool status -xv
     pool: test
    state: ONLINE
   status: One or more devices has experienced an error and no valid replicas
           are available.  Some filesystem data is corrupt, and applications
           may have been affected.
   action: Destroy the pool and restore from backup.
      see: https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/msg/ZFS-8000-8A
    scrub: none requested
   config:

           NAME                  STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
           test                  ONLINE       0     0     2
             c0t0d0              ONLINE       0     0     2
             c0t0d1              ONLINE       0     0     0

   errors: Permanent errors have been detected in the following files:

           /export/example/foo

Damaged files may or may not be able to be removed depending on the
type of corruption.  If the corruption is within the plain data, the
file should be removable.  If the corruption is in the file metadata,
then the file cannot be removed, though it can be moved to an
alternate location.  In either case, the data should be restored from
a backup source.  It is also possible for the corruption to be within
pool-wide metadata, resulting in entire datasets being unavailable.
If this is the case, the only option is to destroy the pool and
re-create the datasets from backup.

.. rubric:: Details

The Message ID: ``ZFS-8000-8A`` indicates corrupted data exists in
the current pool.
