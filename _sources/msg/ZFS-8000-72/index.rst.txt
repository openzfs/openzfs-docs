.. rubric:: Suggested Action for System Administrator

Even though all the devices are available, the on-disk data has been
corrupted such that the pool cannot be opened.  If a recovery action
is presented, the pool can be returned to a usable state.  Otherwise,
all data within the pool is lost, and the pool must be destroyed and
restored from an appropriate backup source.  ZFS includes built-in
metadata replication to prevent this from happening even for
unreplicated pools, but running in a replicated configuration will
decrease the chances of this happening in the future.

If this error is encountered during ``zpool import``, see the section
below.  Otherwise, run ``zpool status -x`` to determine which pool is
faulted and if a recovery option is available:

::

   # zpool status -x
     pool: test
       id: 13783646421373024673
    state: FAULTED
   status: The pool metadata is corrupted and cannot be opened.
   action: Recovery is possible, but will result in some data loss.
           Returning the pool to its state as of Mon Sep 28 10:24:39 2009
           should correct the problem.  Approximately 59 seconds of data
           will have to be discarded, irreversibly.  Recovery can be
           attempted by executing 'zpool clear -F test'.  A scrub of the pool
           is strongly recommended following a successful recovery.
      see: https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/msg/ZFS-8000-72
   config:

           NAME                  STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
           test                  FAULTED      0     0     2  corrupted data
               c0t0d0            ONLINE       0     0     2
               c0t0d1            ONLINE       0     0     2

If recovery is unavailable, the recommended action will be:

::

   action: Destroy the pool and restore from backup.

If this error is encountered during ``zpool import``, and if no recovery option
is mentioned, the pool is unrecoverable and cannot be imported.  The pool must
be restored from an appropriate backup source.  If a recovery option is
available, the output from ``zpool import`` will look something like the
following:

::

   # zpool import share
   cannot import 'share': I/O error
           Recovery is possible, but will result in some data loss.
           Returning the pool to its state as of Sun Sep 27 12:31:07 2009
           should correct the problem.  Approximately 53 seconds of data
           will have to be discarded, irreversibly.  Recovery can be
           attempted by executing 'zpool import -F share'.  A scrub of the pool
           is strongly recommended following a successful recovery.

Recovery actions are requested with the -F option to either ``zpool
clear`` or ``zpool import``.  Recovery will result in some data loss,
because it reverts the pool to an earlier state.  A dry-run recovery
check can be performed by adding the ``-n`` option, affirming if recovery
is possible without actually reverting the pool to its earlier state.

.. rubric:: Details

The Message ID: ``ZFS-8000-72`` indicates a pool was unable to be
