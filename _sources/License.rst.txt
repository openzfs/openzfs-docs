.. note::
   The Linux Kernel is licensed under the GNU General Public License
   Version 2 (`GPLv2 <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl2.html>`__). While
   both (OpenZFS and Linux Kernel) are free open source licenses they are
   restrictive licenses. The combination of them causes problems because it
   prevents using pieces of code exclusively available under one license
   with pieces of code exclusively available under the other in the same binary.
   In the case of the Linux Kernel, this prevents us from distributing OpenZFS
   as part of the Linux Kernel binary. However, there is nothing in either license
   that prevents distributing it in the form of a binary module or in the form
   of source code.
