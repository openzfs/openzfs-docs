Project and Community
=====================

OpenZFS is storage software which combines the functionality of
traditional filesystems, volume manager, and more. OpenZFS includes
protection against data corruption, support for high storage capacities,
efficient data compression, snapshots and copy-on-write clones,
continuous integrity checking and automatic repair, remote replication
with ZFS send and receive, and RAID-Z.

OpenZFS brings together developers from the illumos, Linux, FreeBSD and
OS X platforms, and a wide range of companies -- both online and at the
annual OpenZFS Developer Summit. High-level goals of the project include
raising awareness of the quality, utility and availability of
open-source implementations of ZFS, encouraging open communication about
ongoing efforts toward improving open-source variants of ZFS, and
ensuring consistent reliability, functionality and performance of all
distributions of ZFS.
