ZPOOL-CLEAR(8) - System Manager's Manual

# NAME

**zpool-clear** - clear device errors in ZFS storage pool

# SYNOPSIS

**zpool**
**clear**
\[**--power**]
*pool*
\[*device*]&#8230;

# DESCRIPTION

Clears device errors in a pool.
If no arguments are specified, all device errors within the pool are cleared.
If one or more devices is specified, only those errors associated with the
specified device or devices are cleared.

If the pool was suspended it will be brought back online provided the
devices can be accessed.
Pools with
**multihost**
enabled which have been suspended cannot be resumed when there is evidence
that the pool was imported by another host.
The same checks performed during an import will be applied before the clear
proceeds.

**--power**

> Power on the devices's slot in the storage enclosure and wait for the device
> to show up before attempting to clear errors.
> This is done on all the devices specified.
> Alternatively, you can set the
> **ZPOOL\_AUTO\_POWER\_ON\_SLOT**
> environment variable to always enable this behavior.
> Note: This flag currently works on Linux only.
