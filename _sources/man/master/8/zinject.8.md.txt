# NAME

**zinject** - ZFS Fault Injector

# DESCRIPTION

**zinject**
creates artificial problems in a ZFS pool by simulating data corruption
or device failures.
This program is dangerous.

# SYNOPSIS

**zinject**

> List injection records.

**zinject**
**-b**&nbsp;*objset*:*object*:*level*:*start*:*end*
\[**-f**&nbsp;*frequency*]
**-amu**
\[pool]

> Force an error into the pool at a bookmark.

**zinject**
**-c**&nbsp;*id*|**all**

> Cancel injection records.

**zinject**
**-d**&nbsp;*vdev*
**-A**&nbsp;**degrade**|**fault**
*pool*

> Force a vdev into the DEGRADED or FAULTED state.

**zinject**
**-d**&nbsp;*vdev*
**-D**&nbsp;*latency*:*lanes*
\[**-T**&nbsp;*read|write*]
*pool*

> Add an artificial delay to I/O requests on a particular
> device, such that the requests take a minimum of
> *latency*
> milliseconds to complete.
> Each delay has an associated number of
> *lanes*
> which defines the number of concurrent
> I/O requests that can be processed.

> For example, with a single lane delay of 10 ms
> (**-D** *10*:*1*),
> the device will only be able to service a single I/O request
> at a time with each request taking 10 ms to complete.
> So, if only a single request is submitted every 10 ms, the
> average latency will be 10 ms; but if more than one request
> is submitted every 10 ms, the average latency will be more
> than 10 ms.

> Similarly, if a delay of 10 ms is specified to have two
> lanes
> (**-D** *10*:*2*),
> then the device will be able to service
> two requests at a time, each with a minimum latency of 10 ms.
> So, if two requests are submitted every 10 ms, then
> the average latency will be 10 ms; but if more than two
> requests are submitted every 10 ms, the average latency
> will be more than 10 ms.

> Also note, these delays are additive.
> So two invocations of
> **-D** *10*:*1*
> are roughly equivalent to a single invocation of
> **-D** *10*:*2*.
> This also means, that one can specify multiple
> lanes with differing target latencies.
> For example, an invocation of
> **-D** *10*:*1*
> followed by
> **-D** *25*:*2*
> will create 3 lanes on the device: one lane with a latency
> of 10 ms and two lanes with a 25 ms latency.

# OPTIONS

**-a**

> Flush the ARC before injection.

**-b** *objset*:*object*:*level*:*start*:*end*

> Force an error into the pool at this bookmark tuple.
> Each number is in hexadecimal, and only one block can be specified.

**-C** *dvas*

> Inject the given error only into specific DVAs.
> The mask should be specified as a list of 0-indexed DVAs separated by commas
> (e.g. *0,2*).
> This option is not applicable to logical data errors such as
> **decompress**
> and
> **decrypt**.

**-d** *vdev*

> A vdev specified by path or GUID.

**-e** *device\_error*

> Specify

> **checksum**

> > for an ECKSUM error,

> **decompress**

> > for a data decompression error,

> **decrypt**

> > for a data decryption error,

> **corrupt**

> > to flip a bit in the data after a read,

> **dtl**

> > for an ECHILD error,

> **io**

> > for an EIO error where reopening the device will succeed,

> **nxio**

> > for an ENXIO error where reopening the device will fail, or

> **noop**

> > to drop the IO without executing it, and return success.

> For EIO and ENXIO, the "failed" reads or writes still occur.
> The probe simply sets the error value reported by the I/O pipeline
> so it appears the read or write failed.
> Decryption errors only currently work with file data.

**-f** *frequency*

> Only inject errors a fraction of the time.
> Expressed as a real number percentage between
> **0.0001**
> and
> **100**.

**-F**

> Fail faster.
> Do fewer checks.

**-f** *txgs*

> Run for this many transaction groups before reporting failure.

**-h**

> Print the usage message.

**-l** *level*

> Inject an error at a particular block level.
> The default is
> **0**.

**-L** *label\_error*

> Set the label error region to one of
> **nvlist**,
> **pad1**,
> **pad2**,
> or
> **uber**.

**-m**

> Automatically remount the underlying filesystem.

**-q**

> Quiet mode.
> Only print the handler number added.

**-r** *range*

> Inject an error over a particular logical range of an object, which
> will be translated to the appropriate blkid range according to the
> object's properties.

**-s** *seconds*

> Run for this many seconds before reporting failure.

**-T** *type*

> Inject the error into I/O of this type.

> **read**, **write**, **flush**, **claim**, **free**

> > Fundamental I/O types

> **all**

> > All fundamental I/O types

> **probe**

> > Device probe I/O

**-t** *mos\_type*

> Set this to

> **mos**

> > for any data in the MOS,

> **mosdir**

> > for an object directory,

> **config**

> > for the pool configuration,

> **bpobj**

> > for the block pointer list,

> **spacemap**

> > for the space map,

> **metaslab**

> > for the metaslab, or

> **errlog**

> > for the persistent error log.

**-u**

> Unload the pool after injection.
