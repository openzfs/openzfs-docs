FSCK.ZFS(8) - System Manager's Manual

# NAME

**fsck.zfs** - dummy ZFS filesystem checker

# SYNOPSIS

**fsck.zfs**
\[*options*]
*dataset*&#8230;

# DESCRIPTION

**fsck.zfs**
is a thin shell wrapper that at most checks the status of a dataset's container
pool.
It is installed by OpenZFS because some Linux
distributions expect a fsck helper for all filesystems.

If more than one
*dataset*
is specified, each is checked in turn and the results binary-ored.

# OPTIONS

Ignored.

# NOTES

ZFS datasets are checked by running
**zpool** **scrub**
on the containing pool.
An individual ZFS dataset is never checked independently of its pool,
which is unlike a regular filesystem.

However, the
fsck(8)
interface still allows it to communicate some errors: if the
*dataset*
is in a degraded pool, then
**fsck.zfs**
will return exit code
**4**
to indicate an uncorrected filesystem error.

Similarly, if the
*dataset*
is in a faulted pool and has a legacy
*/etc/fstab*
record, then
**fsck.zfs**
will return exit code
**8**
to indicate a fatal operational error.
