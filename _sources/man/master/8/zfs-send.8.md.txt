## Redaction

ZFS has support for a limited version of data subsetting, in the form of
redaction.
Using the
**zfs** **redact**
command, a
**redaction bookmark**
can be created that stores a list of blocks containing sensitive information.
When provided to
**zfs** **send**,
this causes a
**redacted send**
to occur.
Redacted sends omit the blocks containing sensitive information,
replacing them with REDACT records.
When these send streams are received, a
**redacted dataset**
is created.
A redacted dataset cannot be mounted by default, since it is incomplete.
It can be used to receive other send streams.
In this way datasets can be used for data backup and replication,
with all the benefits that zfs send and receive have to offer,
while protecting sensitive information from being
stored on less-trusted machines or services.

For the purposes of redaction, there are two steps to the process.
A redact step, and a send/receive step.
First, a redaction bookmark is created.
This is done by providing the
**zfs** **redact**
command with a parent snapshot, a bookmark to be created, and a number of
redaction snapshots.
These redaction snapshots must be descendants of the parent snapshot,
and they should modify data that is considered sensitive in some way.
Any blocks of data modified by all of the redaction snapshots will
be listed in the redaction bookmark, because it represents the truly sensitive
information.
When it comes to the send step, the send process will not send
the blocks listed in the redaction bookmark, instead replacing them with
REDACT records.
When received on the target system, this will create a
redacted dataset, missing the data that corresponds to the blocks in the
redaction bookmark on the sending system.
The incremental send streams from
the original parent to the redaction snapshots can then also be received on
the target system, and this will produce a complete snapshot that can be used
normally.
Incrementals from one snapshot on the parent filesystem and another
can also be done by sending from the redaction bookmark, rather than the
snapshots themselves.

In order to make the purpose of the feature more clear, an example is provided.
Consider a zfs filesystem containing four files.
These files represent information for an online shopping service.
One file contains a list of usernames and passwords, another contains purchase
histories,
a third contains click tracking data, and a fourth contains user preferences.
The owner of this data wants to make it available for their development teams to
test against, and their market research teams to do analysis on.
The development teams need information about user preferences and the click
tracking data, while the market research teams need information about purchase
histories and user preferences.
Neither needs access to the usernames and passwords.
However, because all of this data is stored in one ZFS filesystem,
it must all be sent and received together.
In addition, the owner of the data
wants to take advantage of features like compression, checksumming, and
snapshots, so they do want to continue to use ZFS to store and transmit their
data.
Redaction can help them do so.
First, they would make two clones of a snapshot of the data on the source.
In one clone, they create the setup they want their market research team to see;
they delete the usernames and passwords file,
and overwrite the click tracking data with dummy information.
In another, they create the setup they want the development teams
to see, by replacing the passwords with fake information and replacing the
purchase histories with randomly generated ones.
They would then create a redaction bookmark on the parent snapshot,
using snapshots on the two clones as redaction snapshots.
The parent can then be sent, redacted, to the target
server where the research and development teams have access.
Finally, incremental sends from the parent snapshot to each of the clones can be
sent
to and received on the target server; these snapshots are identical to the
ones on the source, and are ready to be used, while the parent snapshot on the
target contains none of the username and password data present on the source,
because it was removed by the redacted send operation.

**-v**.

# EXAMPLES

## Example 1: Remotely Replicating ZFS Data

The following commands send a full stream and then an incremental stream to a
remote machine, restoring them into
*poolB/received/fs@a*
and
*poolB/received/fs@b*,
respectively.
*poolB*
must contain the file system
*poolB/received*,
and must not initially contain
*poolB/received/fs*.

	# **zfs** **send** *pool/fs@a* |
	    **ssh** *host* **zfs** **receive** *poolB/received/fs*@*a*
	# **zfs** **send** **-i** *a pool/fs@b* |
	    **ssh** *host* **zfs** **receive** *poolB/received/fs*

## Example 2: Using the **zfs** **receive** **-d** Option

The following command sends a full stream of
*poolA/fsA/fsB@snap*
to a remote machine, receiving it into
*poolB/received/fsA/fsB@snap*.
The
*fsA/fsB@snap*
portion of the received snapshot's name is determined from the name of the sent
snapshot.
*poolB*
must contain the file system
*poolB/received*.
If
*poolB/received/fsA*
does not exist, it is created as an empty file system.

	# **zfs** **send** *poolA/fsA/fsB@snap* |
	    **ssh** *host* **zfs** **receive** **-d** *poolB/received*
