# DESCRIPTION

**zfs**
**mount**
\[**-j**]

> Displays all ZFS file systems currently mounted.

> **-j**, **--json**

> > Displays all mounted file systems in JSON format.

**zfs**
**mount**
\[**-Oflv**]
\[**-o** *options*]
**-a**|**-R** *filesystem*|*filesystem*

> Mount ZFS filesystem on a path described by its
> **mountpoint**
> property, if the path exists and is empty.
> If
> **mountpoint**
> is set to
> *legacy*,
> the filesystem should be instead mounted using
> mount(8).

> **-O**

> > Perform an overlay mount.
> > Allows mounting in non-empty
> > **mountpoint**.
> > See
> > mount(8)
> > for more information.

> **-a**

> > Mount all available ZFS file systems.
> > Invoked automatically as part of the boot process if configured.

> **-R**

> > Mount the specified filesystems along with all their children.

> *filesystem*

> > Mount the specified filesystem.

> **-o** *options*

> > An optional, comma-separated list of mount options to use temporarily for the
> > duration of the mount.
> > See the
> > *Temporary Mount Point Properties*
> > section of
> > zfsprops(7)
> > for details.

> **-l**

> > Load keys for encrypted filesystems as they are being mounted.
> > This is equivalent to executing
> > **zfs** **load-key**
> > on each encryption root before mounting it.
> > Note that if a filesystem has
> > **keylocation**=**prompt**,
> > this will cause the terminal to interactively block after asking for the key.
> > On systems with PAM support,
> > pam\_zfs\_key(8)
> > can automate this process during user login.

> **-v**

> > Report mount progress.

> **-f**

> > Attempt to force mounting of all filesystems, even those that couldn't normally
> > be mounted (e.g. redacted datasets).

**zfs**
**unmount**
\[**-fu**]
**-a**|*filesystem*|*mountpoint*

> Unmounts currently mounted ZFS file systems.

> **-a**

> > Unmount all available ZFS file systems.
> > Invoked automatically as part of the shutdown process.

> **-f**

> > Forcefully unmount the file system, even if it is currently in use.
> > This option is not supported on Linux.

> **-u**

> > Unload keys for any encryption roots unmounted by this command.

> *filesystem*|*mountpoint*

> > Unmount the specified filesystem.
> > The command can also be given a path to a ZFS file system mount point on the
> > system.
