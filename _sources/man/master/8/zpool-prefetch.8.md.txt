ZPOOL-PREFETCH(8) - System Manager's Manual

# NAME

**zpool-prefetch** - Prefetches pool metadata into ARC

# SYNOPSIS

**zpool**
**prefetch**
\[**-t**&nbsp;*type*]
*pool*

# DESCRIPTION

Massively prefetch metadata of a specific type for the given pool into the ARC
to reduce latency of some operations later.
If no type is specified, all types are prefetched.

The following types are supported:

**brt**

> Prefetch the BRT (block reference table).
> This may improve performance for block cloning operations,
> and frees for earlier cloned blocks.

**ddt**

> Prefetch the DDT (deduplication table).
> This may improve performance of writes when deduplication is enabled,
> and frees for earlier deduplicated blocks.
