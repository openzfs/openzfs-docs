*pool*

# DESCRIPTION

Checkpoints the current state of

**remove**, **attach**, **detach**, **split**, and **reguid**.
In addition, it may break reservation boundaries if the pool lacks free
space.
The
**zpool** **status**
command indicates the existence of a checkpoint or the progress of discarding a
checkpoint from a pool.
**zpool** **list**
can be used to check how much space the checkpoint takes from the pool.
