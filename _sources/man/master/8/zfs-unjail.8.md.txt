ZFS-JAIL(8) - System Manager's Manual

# NAME

**zfs-jail** - attach or detach ZFS filesystem from FreeBSD jail

# SYNOPSIS

**zfs&nbsp;**jail**&zwnj;**
*jailid*|*jailname*
*filesystem*  
**zfs&nbsp;**unjail**&zwnj;**
*jailid*|*jailname*
*filesystem*

# DESCRIPTION

The
**zfs-jail**
functionality can be used to assign a dataset onto a running
FreeBSD
system
jail(4),
allowing
zfs(8)
management utilities to be run inside of the
jail(4).

To allow management of the dataset from within a jail, the
**jailed**
property should be set and the required
devfs.conf(5)
entries to expose
*/dev/zfs*
device within the jail must be present.
The
**quota**
property cannot be changed from within a jail.

To use this functionality, the jail needs the
**allow.mount**
and
**allow.mount.zfs**
parameters set to
**1**
and the
**enforce\_statfs**
parameter set to a value lower than
**2**.

The subcommands are as follows:

**jail**
*jailid*|*jailname*
*filesystem*

> Attach the specified
> *filesystem*
> to the jail identified by JID
> *jailid*
> or name
> *jailname*.
> From now on this file system tree can be managed from within a jail if the
> **jailed**
> property has been set.

> You cannot attach a jailed dataset's children to another jail.
> You can also not attach the root file system
> of the jail or any dataset which needs to be mounted before the zfs rc script
> is run inside the jail, as it would be attached unmounted until it is
> mounted from the rc script inside the jail.

> After a dataset is attached to a jail and the
> **jailed**
> property is set, a jailed file system cannot be mounted outside the jail,
> since the jail administrator might have set the mount point to an unacceptable
> value.

**unjail**
*jailid*|*jailname*
*filesystem*

> Detaches the specified
> *filesystem*
> from the jail identified by JID
> *jailid*
> or name
> *jailname*.

# CAVEATS

The root directory of jail can not be delegated to the jail with this
utility because the jail must be running with a valid root directory.

Jails are a
FreeBSD
feature and are not relevant on other platforms.
See
jail(8)
for more information on managing jails, or
zfs-zone(8)
for the equivelant functionality on Linux.
