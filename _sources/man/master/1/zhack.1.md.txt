ZHACK(1) - General Commands Manual

# NAME

**zhack** - libzpool debugging tool

# DESCRIPTION

This utility pokes configuration changes directly into a ZFS pool,
which is dangerous and can cause data corruption.

# SYNOPSIS

**zhack**
**feature&nbsp;stat**
*pool*

> List feature flags.

**zhack**
**feature&nbsp;enable**
\[**-d**&nbsp;*description*]
\[**-r**]
*pool*
*guid*

> Add a new feature to
> *pool*
> that is uniquely identified by
> *guid*,
> which is specified in the same form as a
> zfs(8)
> user property.

> The
> *description*
> is a short human readable explanation of the new feature.

> The
> **-r**
> flag indicates that
> *pool*
> can be safely opened in read-only mode by a system that does not understand the
> *guid*
> feature.

**zhack**
**feature&nbsp;ref**
\[**-d**|**-m**]
*pool*
*guid*

> Increment the reference count of the
> *guid*
> feature in
> *pool*.

> The
> **-d**
> flag decrements the reference count of the
> *guid*
> feature in
> *pool*
> instead.

> The
> **-m**
> flag indicates that the
> *guid*
> feature is now required to read the pool MOS.

**zhack**
**label&nbsp;repair**
\[**-cu**]
*device*

> Repair labels of a specified
> *device*
> according to options.

> Flags may be combined to do their functions simultaneously.

> The
> **-c**
> flag repairs corrupted label checksums

> The
> **-u**
> flag restores the label on a detached device

> Example:  
> **zhack&nbsp;**label&nbsp;repair**&nbsp;**-cu**&nbsp;*device*&zwnj;**
>   Fix checksums and undetach a device

**zhack**
**metaslab&nbsp;leak**
\[**-f**]
*pool*

> Apply a fragmentation profile generated by
> **zdb**
> to the specified
> *pool*.

> The
> **-f**
> flag forces the profile to apply even if the vdevs in the
> *pool*
> don't have the same number of metaslabs as the fragmentation profile.

# GLOBAL OPTIONS

The following can be passed to all
**zhack**
invocations before any subcommand:

**-c** *cachefile*

> Read
> *pool*
> configuration from the
> *cachefile*,
> which is
> */etc/zfs/zpool.cache*
> by default.

**-d** *dir*

> Search for
> *pool*
> members in
> *dir*.
> Can be specified more than once.

**-o** *var*=*value*

> Set the given tunable to the provided value.

# EXAMPLES

	# **zhack** **feature stat** *tank*
	for_read_obj:
		org.illumos:lz4_compress = 0
	for_write_obj:
		com.delphix:async_destroy = 0
		com.delphix:empty_bpobj = 0
	descriptions_obj:
		com.delphix:async_destroy = Destroy filesystems asynchronously.
		com.delphix:empty_bpobj = Snapshots use less space.
		org.illumos:lz4_compress = LZ4 compression algorithm support.
