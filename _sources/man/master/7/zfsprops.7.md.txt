ZFSPROPS(7) - Miscellaneous Information Manual

# NAME

**zfsprops** - native and user-defined properties of ZFS datasets

# DESCRIPTION

Properties are divided into two types, native properties and user-defined
(or
"user")
properties.
Native properties either export internal statistics or control ZFS behavior.
In addition, native properties are either editable or read-only.
User properties have no effect on ZFS behavior, but you can use them to annotate
datasets in a way that is meaningful in your environment.
For more information about user properties, see the
*User Properties*
section, below.

## Native Properties

Every dataset has a set of properties that export statistics about the dataset
as well as control various behaviors.
Properties are inherited from the parent unless overridden by the child.
Some properties apply only to certain types of datasets
(file systems, volumes, or snapshots).

The values of numeric properties can be specified using human-readable suffixes
(for example,
**k**,
**KB**,
**M**,
**Gb**,
and so forth, up to
**Z**
for zettabyte)
.
The following are all valid
(and equal)
specifications:
`1536M`,
`1.5g`,
`1.50GB`.

The values of non-numeric properties are case sensitive and must be lowercase,
except for
**mountpoint**,
**sharenfs**,
and
**sharesmb**.

The following native properties consist of read-only statistics about the
dataset.
These properties can be neither set, nor inherited.
Native properties apply to all dataset types unless otherwise noted.

**available**

> The amount of space available to the dataset and all its children, assuming that
> there is no other activity in the pool.
> Because space is shared within a pool, availability can be limited by any number
> of factors, including physical pool size, quotas, reservations, or other
> datasets within the pool.

> This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name,
> **avail**.

**compressratio**

> For non-snapshots, the compression ratio achieved for the
> **used**
> space of this dataset, expressed as a multiplier.
> The
> **used**
> property includes descendant datasets, and, for clones, does not include the
> space shared with the origin snapshot.
> For snapshots, the
> **compressratio**
> is the same as the
> **refcompressratio**
> property.
> Compression can be turned on by running:
> **zfs** **set** **compression**=**on** *dataset*.
> The default value is
> **off**.

**createtxg**

> The transaction group (txg) in which the dataset was created.
> Bookmarks have the same
> **createtxg**
> as the snapshot they are initially tied to.
> This property is suitable for ordering a list of snapshots,
> e.g. for incremental send and receive.

**creation**

> The time this dataset was created.

**clones**

> For snapshots, this property is a comma-separated list of filesystems or volumes
> which are clones of this snapshot.
> The clones'
> **origin**
> property is this snapshot.
> If the
> **clones**
> property is not empty, then this snapshot can not be destroyed
> (even with the
> **-r**
> or
> **-f**
> options)
> .
> The roles of origin and clone can be swapped by promoting the clone with the
> **zfs** **promote**
> command.

**defer\_destroy**

> This property is
> **on**
> if the snapshot has been marked for deferred destroy by using the
> **zfs** **destroy** **-d**
> command.
> Otherwise, the property is
> **off**.

**encryptionroot**

> For encrypted datasets, indicates where the dataset is currently inheriting its
> encryption key from.
> Loading or unloading a key for the
> **encryptionroot**
> will implicitly load / unload the key for any inheriting datasets (see
> **zfs** **load-key**
> and
> **zfs** **unload-key**
> for details).
> Clones will always share an
> encryption key with their origin.
> See the
> *Encryption*
> section of
> zfs-load-key(8)
> for details.

**filesystem\_count**

> The total number of filesystems and volumes that exist under this location in
> the dataset tree.
> This value is only available when a
> **filesystem\_limit**
> has been set somewhere in the tree under which the dataset resides.

**keystatus**

> Indicates if an encryption key is currently loaded into ZFS.
> The possible values are
> **none**,
> **available**,
> and
> **unavailable**.
> See
> **zfs** **load-key**
> and
> **zfs** **unload-key**.

**guid**

> The 64 bit GUID of this dataset or bookmark which does not change over its
> entire lifetime.
> When a snapshot is sent to another pool, the received snapshot has the same
> GUID.
> Thus, the
> **guid**
> is suitable to identify a snapshot across pools.

**logicalreferenced**

> The amount of space that is
> "logically"
> accessible by this dataset.
> See the
> **referenced**
> property.
> The logical space ignores the effect of the
> **compression**
> and
> **copies**
> properties, giving a quantity closer to the amount of data that applications
> see.
> However, it does include space consumed by metadata.

> This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name,
> **lrefer**.

**logicalused**

> The amount of space that is
> "logically"
> consumed by this dataset and all its descendants.
> See the
> **used**
> property.
> The logical space ignores the effect of the
> **compression**
> and
> **copies**
> properties, giving a quantity closer to the amount of data that applications
> see.
> However, it does include space consumed by metadata.

> This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name,
> **lused**.

**mounted**

> For file systems, indicates whether the file system is currently mounted.
> This property can be either
> **yes**
> or
> **no**.

**objsetid**

> A unique identifier for this dataset within the pool.
> Unlike the dataset's
> **guid**, the **objsetid**
> of a dataset is not transferred to other pools when the snapshot is copied
> with a send/receive operation.
> The
> **objsetid**
> can be reused (for a new dataset) after the dataset is deleted.

**origin**

> For cloned file systems or volumes, the snapshot from which the clone was
> created.
> See also the
> **clones**
> property.

**receive\_resume\_token**

> For filesystems or volumes which have saved partially-completed state from
> **zfs** **receive** **-s**,
> this opaque token can be provided to
> **zfs** **send** **-t**
> to resume and complete the
> **zfs** **receive**.

**redact\_snaps**

> For bookmarks, this is the list of snapshot GUIDs the bookmark contains a
> redaction
> list for.
> For snapshots, this is the list of snapshot GUIDs the snapshot is redacted with
> respect to.

**referenced**

> The amount of data that is accessible by this dataset, which may or may not be
> shared with other datasets in the pool.
> When a snapshot or clone is created, it initially references the same amount of
> space as the file system or snapshot it was created from, since its contents are
> identical.

> This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name,
> **refer**.

**refcompressratio**

> The compression ratio achieved for the
> **referenced**
> space of this dataset, expressed as a multiplier.
> See also the
> **compressratio**
> property.

**snapshot\_count**

> The total number of snapshots that exist under this location in the dataset
> tree.
> This value is only available when a
> **snapshot\_limit**
> has been set somewhere in the tree under which the dataset resides.

**type**

> The type of dataset:
> **filesystem**,
> **volume**,
> **snapshot**,
> or
> **bookmark**.

**used**

> The amount of space consumed by this dataset and all its descendants.
> This is the value that is checked against this dataset's quota and reservation.
> The space used does not include this dataset's reservation, but does take into
> account the reservations of any descendent datasets.
> The amount of space that a dataset consumes from its parent, as well as the
> amount of space that is freed if this dataset is recursively destroyed, is the
> greater of its space used and its reservation.

> The used space of a snapshot
> (see the
> *Snapshots*
> section of
> zfsconcepts(7))
> is space that is referenced exclusively by this snapshot.
> If this snapshot is destroyed, the amount of
> **used**
> space will be freed.
> Space that is shared by multiple snapshots isn't accounted for in this metric.
> When a snapshot is destroyed, space that was previously shared with this
> snapshot can become unique to snapshots adjacent to it, thus changing the used
> space of those snapshots.
> The used space of the latest snapshot can also be affected by changes in the
> file system.
> Note that the
> **used**
> space of a snapshot is a subset of the
> **written**
> space of the snapshot.

> The amount of space used, available, or referenced does not take into account
> pending changes.
> Pending changes are generally accounted for within a few seconds.
> Committing a change to a disk using
> fsync(2)
> or
> **O\_SYNC**
> does not necessarily guarantee that the space usage information is updated
> immediately.

**usedby\*&zwnj;**

> The
> **usedby\*&zwnj;**
> properties decompose the
> **used**
> properties into the various reasons that space is used.
> Specifically,
> **used** =
> **usedbychildren** +
> **usedbydataset** +
> **usedbyrefreservation** +
> **usedbysnapshots**.
> These properties are only available for datasets created on
> **zpool**
> "version 13"
> pools.

**usedbychildren**

> The amount of space used by children of this dataset, which would be freed if
> all the dataset's children were destroyed.

**usedbydataset**

> The amount of space used by this dataset itself, which would be freed if the
> dataset were destroyed
> (after first removing any
> **refreservation**
> and destroying any necessary snapshots or descendants)
> .

**usedbyrefreservation**

> The amount of space used by a
> **refreservation**
> set on this dataset, which would be freed if the
> **refreservation**
> was removed.

**usedbysnapshots**

> The amount of space consumed by snapshots of this dataset.
> In particular, it is the amount of space that would be freed if all of this
> dataset's snapshots were destroyed.
> Note that this is not simply the sum of the snapshots'
> **used**
> properties because space can be shared by multiple snapshots.

**userused**@*user*

> The amount of space consumed by the specified user in this dataset.
> Space is charged to the owner of each file, as displayed by
> **ls** **-l**.
> The amount of space charged is displayed by
> **du** and **ls** **-s**.
> See the
> **zfs** **userspace**
> command for more information.

> Unprivileged users can access only their own space usage.
> The root user, or a user who has been granted the
> **userused**
> privilege with
> **zfs** **allow**,
> can access everyone's usage.

> The
> **userused**@*&#8230;*
> properties are not displayed by
> **zfs** **get** **all**.
> The user's name must be appended after the
> **@**
> symbol, using one of the following forms:

> *	POSIX name
> 	("joe")
> *	POSIX numeric ID
> 	("789")
> *	SID name
> 	("joe.smith@mydomain")
> *	SID numeric ID
> 	("S-1-123-456-789")

> Files created on Linux always have POSIX owners.

**userobjused**@*user*

> The
> **userobjused**
> property is similar to
> **userused**
> but instead it counts the number of objects consumed by a user.
> This property counts all objects allocated on behalf of the user,
> it may differ from the results of system tools such as
> **df** **-i**.

> When the property
> **xattr**=**on**
> is set on a file system additional objects will be created per-file to store
> extended attributes.
> These additional objects are reflected in the
> **userobjused**
> value and are counted against the user's
> **userobjquota**.
> When a file system is configured to use
> **xattr**=**sa**
> no additional internal objects are normally required.

**userrefs**

> This property is set to the number of user holds on this snapshot.
> User holds are set by using the
> **zfs** **hold**
> command.

**groupused**@*group*

> The amount of space consumed by the specified group in this dataset.
> Space is charged to the group of each file, as displayed by
> **ls** **-l**.
> See the
> **userused**@*user*

**groupobjused**@*group*

> The number of objects consumed by the specified group in this dataset.
> Multiple objects may be charged to the group for each file when extended
> attributes are in use.
> See the
> **userobjused**@*user*

**projectused**@*project*

> The amount of space consumed by the specified project in this dataset.
> Project is identified via the project identifier (ID) that is object-based
> numeral attribute.
> An object can inherit the project ID from its parent object (if the
> parent has the flag of inherit project ID that can be set and changed via
> **chattr** **-/+P**
> or

**snapshots\_changed**

> Provides a mechanism to quickly determine whether snapshot list has
> changed without having to mount a dataset or iterate the snapshot list.
> Specifies the time at which a snapshot for a dataset was last
> created or deleted.

> This allows us to be more efficient how often we query snapshots.
> The property is persistent across mount and unmount operations only if the
> **extensible\_dataset**
> feature is enabled.

**snapshots\_changed\_nsecs**

> Specifies the UTC time at which a snapshot for a dataset was last created
> or deleted, expressed as the number of nanoseconds since the Unix epoch.
> This is a high-precision version of
> **snapshots\_changed**,
> representing the same instant with nanosecond instead of second resolution.
> The property is persistent across mount and unmount operations only if the
> **extensible\_dataset**
> feature is enabled.

**volblocksize**

> For volumes, specifies the block size of the volume.
> The
> **blocksize**

The following native properties can be used to change the behavior of a ZFS
dataset.

**aclinherit**=**discard**|**noallow**|**restricted**|**passthrough**|**passthrough-x**

> Controls how ACEs are inherited when files and directories are created.

> **discard**

> > does not inherit any ACEs.

> **noallow**

> > only inherits inheritable ACEs that specify
> > "deny"
> > permissions.

> **restricted**

> > default, removes the
> > **write\_acl**
> > and
> > **write\_owner**
> > permissions when the ACE is inherited.

> **passthrough**

> > inherits all inheritable ACEs without any modifications.

> **passthrough-x**

> > same meaning as
> > **passthrough**,
> > except that the
> > **owner@**, **group@**, and **everyone@**
> > ACEs inherit the execute permission only if the file creation mode also requests
> > the execute bit.

> When the property value is set to
> **passthrough**,
> files are created with a mode determined by the inheritable ACEs.
> If no inheritable ACEs exist that affect the mode, then the mode is set in
> accordance to the requested mode from the application.

> The
> **aclinherit**
> property does not apply to POSIX ACLs.

**aclmode**=**discard**|**groupmask**|**passthrough**|**restricted**

> Controls how an ACL is modified during chmod(2) and how inherited ACEs
> are modified by the file creation mode:

> **discard**

> > default, deletes all
> > **ACEs**
> > except for those representing
> > the mode of the file or directory requested by
> > chmod(2).

> **groupmask**

> > reduces permissions granted in all
> > **ALLOW**
> > entries found in the
> > **ACL**
> > such that they are no greater than the group permissions specified by
> > chmod(2).

> **passthrough**

> > indicates that no changes are made to the ACL other than creating or updating
> > the necessary ACL entries to represent the new mode of the file or directory.

> **restricted**

> > will cause the
> > chmod(2)
> > operation to return an error when used on any file or directory which has
> > a non-trivial ACL whose entries can not be represented by a mode.
> > chmod(2)
> > is required to change the set user ID, set group ID, or sticky bits on a file

> > on a file or directory with a non-trivial ACL when
> > **aclmode**
> > is set to
> > **restricted**,
> > you must first remove all ACL entries which do not represent the current mode.

**acltype**=**off**|**nfsv4**|**posix**

> Controls whether ACLs are enabled and if so what type of ACL to use.
> When this property is set to a type of ACL not supported by the current
> platform, the behavior is the same as if it were set to
> **off**.

> **off**

> > default on Linux, when a file system has the
> > **acltype**
> > property set to off then ACLs are disabled.

> **noacl**

> > an alias for
> > **off**

> **nfsv4**

> > default on
> > FreeBSD,
> > indicates that NFSv4-style ZFS ACLs should be used.
> > These ACLs can be managed with the
> > getfacl(1)
> > and
> > setfacl(1).
> > The
> > **nfsv4**
> > ZFS ACL type is not yet supported on Linux.

> **posix**

> > indicates POSIX ACLs should be used.
> > POSIX ACLs are specific to Linux and are not functional on other platforms.
> > POSIX ACLs are stored as an extended
> > attribute and therefore will not overwrite any existing NFSv4 ACLs which
> > may be set.

> **posixacl**

> > an alias for
> > **posix**

> To obtain the best performance when setting
> **posix**
> users are strongly encouraged to set the
> **xattr**=**sa**
> property.
> This will result in the POSIX ACL being stored more efficiently on disk.
> But as a consequence, all new extended attributes will only be
> accessible from OpenZFS implementations which support the
> **xattr**=**sa**
> property.
> See the
> **xattr**
> property for more details.

**atime**=**on**|**off**

> Controls whether the access time for files is updated when they are read.
> Turning this property off avoids producing write traffic when reading files and
> can result in significant performance gains, though it might confuse mailers
> and other similar utilities.
> The values
> **on**
> and
> **off**
> are equivalent to the
> **atime**
> and
> **noatime**
> mount options.
> The default value is
> **on**.
> See also
> **relatime**
> below.

**canmount**=**on**|**off**|**noauto**

> If this property is set to
> **off**,
> the file system cannot be mounted, and is ignored by
> **zfs** **mount** **-a**.
> Setting this property to
> **off**
> is similar to setting the
> **mountpoint**
> property to
> **none**,
> except that the dataset still has a normal
> **mountpoint**
> property, which can be inherited.
> Setting this property to
> **off**
> allows datasets to be used solely as a mechanism to inherit properties.
> One example of setting
> **canmount**=**off**
> is to have two datasets with the same
> **mountpoint**,
> so that the children of both datasets appear in the same directory, but might
> have different inherited characteristics.

> When set to
> **noauto**,
> a dataset can only be mounted and unmounted explicitly.
> The dataset is not mounted automatically when the dataset is created or
> imported, nor is it mounted by the
> **zfs** **mount** **-a**
> command or unmounted by the
> **zfs** **unmount** **-a**
> command.

> This property is not inherited.

**checksum**=**on**|**off**|**fletcher2**|**fletcher4**|**sha256**|**noparity**|**sha512**|**skein**|**edonr**|**blake3**

> Controls the checksum used to verify data integrity.
> The default value is
> **on**,
> which automatically selects an appropriate algorithm
> (currently,
> **fletcher4**,
> but this may change in future releases)
> .
> The value
> **off**
> disables integrity checking on user data.
> The value
> **noparity**
> not only disables integrity but also disables maintaining parity for user data.
> This setting is used internally by a dump device residing on a RAID-Z pool and
> should not be used by any other dataset.
> Disabling checksums is
> *NOT*
> a recommended practice.

> The
> **sha512**,
> **skein**,
> **edonr**,
> and
> **blake3**
> checksum algorithms require enabling the appropriate features on the pool.

> Please see
> zpool-features(7)
> for more information on these algorithms.

> Changing this property affects only newly-written data.

**compression**=**on**|**off**|**gzip**|**gzip-**&zwnj;*N*|**lz4**|**lzjb**|**zle**|**zstd**|**zstd-**&zwnj;*N*|**zstd-fast**|**zstd-fast-**&zwnj;*N*

> Controls the compression algorithm used for this dataset.

> When set to
> **on**
> (the default), indicates that the current default compression algorithm should
> be used.
> The default balances compression and decompression speed, with compression ratio
> and is expected to work well on a wide variety of workloads.
> Unlike all other settings for this property,
> **on**
> does not select a fixed compression type.
> As new compression algorithms are added to ZFS and enabled on a pool, the
> default compression algorithm may change.
> The current default compression algorithm is either
> **lzjb**
> or, if the
> **lz4\_compress**
> feature is enabled,
> **lz4**.

> The
> **lz4**
> compression algorithm is a high-performance replacement for the
> **lzjb**
> algorithm.
> It features significantly faster compression and decompression, as well as a

> **lz4\_compress**
> feature set to
> **enabled**.
> See
> zpool-features(7)
> for details on ZFS feature flags and the
> **lz4\_compress**
> feature.

> The
> **lzjb**
> compression algorithm is optimized for performance while providing decent data
> compression.

> The
> **gzip**
> compression algorithm uses the same compression as the
> gzip(1)
> command.
> You can specify the
> **gzip**
> level by using the value
> **gzip-**&zwnj;*N*,
> where
> *N*
> is an integer from 1
> (fastest)
> to 9
> (best compression ratio).
> Currently,
> **gzip**
> is equivalent to
> **gzip-6**
> (which is also the default for
> gzip(1))
> .

> The
> **zstd**
> compression algorithm provides both high compression ratios and good
> performance.
> You can specify the
> **zstd**
> level by using the value
> **zstd-**&zwnj;*N*,
> where
> *N*
> is an integer from 1
> (fastest)
> to 19
> (best compression ratio).
> **zstd**
> is equivalent to
> **zstd-3**.

> Faster speeds at the cost of the compression ratio can be requested by
> setting a negative
> **zstd**
> level.
> This is done using
> **zstd-fast-**&zwnj;*N*,
> where
> *N*
> is an integer in
> \[**1**-**10**, **20**, **30**, &#8230;, **100**, **500**, **1000**]
> which maps to a negative
> **zstd**
> level.
> The lower the level the faster the compression &#8212;
> **1000**
> provides the fastest compression and lowest compression ratio.
> **zstd-fast**
> is equivalent to
> **zstd-fast-**&zwnj;*1*.

> The
> **zle**
> compression algorithm compresses runs of zeros.

> This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name
> **compress**.
> Changing this property affects only newly-written data.

> When any setting except
> **off**
> is selected, compression will explicitly check for blocks consisting of only
> zeroes (the NUL byte).
> When a zero-filled block is detected, it is stored as
> a hole and not compressed using the indicated compression algorithm.

> All blocks are allocated as a whole number of sectors
> (chunks of 2^**ashift** bytes, e.g. **512B** or **4KB**).
> Compression may result in a non-sector-aligned size, which will be rounded up
> to a whole number of sectors.
> If compression saves less than one whole sector,
> the block will be stored uncompressed.
> Therefore, blocks whose logical size is a small number of sectors will
> experience less compression
> (e.g. for
> **recordsize**=**16K**

The following three properties cannot be changed after the file system is
created, and therefore, should be set when the file system is created.
If the properties are not set with the
**zfs** **create**
or
**zpool** **create**
commands, these properties are inherited from the parent dataset.
If the parent dataset lacks these properties due to having been created prior to
these features being supported, the new file system will have the default values
for these properties.

**casesensitivity**=**sensitive**|**insensitive**|**mixed**

> Indicates whether the file name matching algorithm used by the file system
> should be case-sensitive, case-insensitive, or allow a combination of both
> styles of matching.
> The default value for the

> The

> property indicates that the file system can support requests for both
> case-sensitive and case-insensitive matching behavior.
> Currently, case-insensitive matching behavior on a file system that supports
> mixed behavior is limited to the SMB server product.
> For more information about the
> **mixed**
> value behavior, see the "ZFS Administration Guide".

**normalization**=**none**|**formC**|**formD**|**formKC**|**formKD**

> Indicates whether the file system should perform a
> **Unicode**
> normalization of file names whenever two file names are compared, and which
> normalization algorithm should be used.
> File names are always stored unmodified, names are normalized as part of any
> comparison process.
> If this property is set to a legal value other than
> **none**,
> and the
> **utf8only**
> property was left unspecified, the
> **utf8only**
> property is automatically set to
> **on**.
> The default value of the
> **normalization**

> **none**.
> This property cannot be changed after the file system is created.

**utf8only**=**on**|**off**

> Indicates whether the file system should reject file names that include
> characters that are not present in the
> **UTF-8**
> character code set.
> If this property is explicitly set to

The
**casesensitivity**,
**normalization**,
and
**utf8only**
properties are also new permissions that can be assigned to non-privileged users
by using the ZFS delegated administration feature.

## Temporary Mount Point Properties

When a file system is mounted, either through
mount(8)
for legacy mounts or the
**zfs** **mount**
command for normal file systems, its mount options are set according to its
properties.
The correlation between properties and mount options is as follows:

**atime**

> atime/noatime

**canmount**

> auto/noauto

**devices**

> dev/nodev

**exec**

> exec/noexec

**readonly**

> ro/rw

**relatime**

> relatime/norelatime

**setuid**

> suid/nosuid

**xattr**

> xattr/noxattr

**nbmand**

> mand/nomand

**context**=

> context=

**fscontext**=

> fscontext=

**defcontext**=

> defcontext=

**rootcontext**=

> rootcontext=

In addition, these options can be set on a per-mount basis using the
**-o**
option, without affecting the property that is stored on disk.
The values specified on the command line override the values stored in the
dataset.
The
**nosuid**
option is an alias for
**nodevices**,**nosetuid**.
These properties are reported as
"temporary"
by the
**zfs** **get**
command.
If the properties are changed while the dataset is mounted, the new setting
overrides any temporary settings.

## User Properties

In addition to the standard native properties, ZFS supports arbitrary user
properties.
User properties have no effect on ZFS behavior, but applications or
administrators can use them to annotate datasets
(file systems, volumes, and snapshots).

User property names must contain a colon
("**:**")
character to distinguish them from native properties.
They may contain lowercase letters, numbers, and the following punctuation
characters: colon
("**:**"),
dash
("**-**"),
period
("**.**"),
and underscore
("**\_**").
The expected convention is that the property name is divided into two portions
such as
*module*:*property*,
but this namespace is not enforced by ZFS.
User property names can be at most 256 characters, and cannot begin with a dash
("**-**").

When making programmatic use of user properties, it is strongly suggested to use
a reversed DNS domain name for the
*module*
component of property names to reduce the chance that two
independently-developed packages use the same property name for different
purposes.

The values of user properties are arbitrary strings, are always inherited, and
are never validated.
All of the commands that operate on properties
(**zfs** **list**,
**zfs** **get**,
**zfs** **set**,
and so forth)
can be used to manipulate both native properties and user properties.
Use the
**zfs** **inherit**
command to clear a user property.
If the property is not defined in any parent dataset, it is removed entirely.
Property values are limited to 8192 bytes.
