Debian GNU Linux initrd documentation
=====================================

Supported boot parameters
*************************

-  rollback=<on|yes|1> Do a rollback of specified snapshot.
-  zfs_debug=<on|yes|1> Debug the initrd script
-  zfs_force=<on|yes|1> Force importing the pool. Should not be
   necessary.
-  zfs=<off|no|0> Don't try to import ANY pool, mount ANY filesystem or
   even load the module.
-  rpool=<pool> Use this pool for root pool.
-  bootfs=<pool>/<dataset> Use this dataset for root filesystem.
-  root=<pool>/<dataset> Use this dataset for root filesystem.
-  root=ZFS=<pool>/<dataset> Use this dataset for root filesystem.
-  root=zfs:<pool>/<dataset> Use this dataset for root filesystem.
-  root=zfs:AUTO Try to detect both pool and rootfs

In all these cases, <dataset> could also be <dataset>@<snapshot>.

The reason there are so many supported boot options to get the root
filesystem, is that there are a lot of different ways too boot ZFS out
there, and I wanted to make sure I supported them all.

Pool imports
************

Import using /dev/disk/by-\*
----------------------------

The initrd will, if the variable USE_DISK_BY_ID is set in the file
/etc/default/zfs, to import using the /dev/disk/by-\* links. It will try
to import in this order:

1. /dev/disk/by-vdev
2. /dev/disk/by-\*
3. /dev

Import using cache file
-----------------------

If all of these imports fail (or if USE_DISK_BY_ID is unset), it will
then try to import using the cache file.

Last ditch attempt at importing
-------------------------------

If that ALSO fails, it will try one more time, without any -d or -c
options.

Booting
*******

Booting from snapshot:
----------------------

Enter the snapshot for the root= parameter like in this example:

::

   linux   /BOOT/debian@/boot/vmlinuz-5.10.0-9-amd64 root=ZFS=rpool/ROOT/debian@some_snapshot ro

This will clone the snapshot rpool/ROOT/debian@some_snapshot into the
filesystem rpool/ROOT/debian_some_snapshot and use that as root
filesystem. The original filesystem and snapshot is left alone in this
case.

**BEWARE** that it will first destroy, blindingly, the
rpool/ROOT/debian_some_snapshot filesystem before trying to clone the
snapshot into it again. So if you've booted from the same snapshot
previously and done some changes in that root filesystem, they will be
undone by the destruction of the filesystem.

Snapshot rollback
-----------------

From version 0.6.4-1-3 it is now also possible to specify rollback=1 to
do a rollback of the snapshot instead of cloning it. **BEWARE** that
this will destroy *all* snapshots done after the specified snapshot!

Select snapshot dynamically
---------------------------

From version 0.6.4-1-3 it is now also possible to specify a NULL
snapshot name (such as root=rpool/ROOT/debian@) and if so, the initrd
script will discover all snapshots below that filesystem (sans the at),
and output a list of snapshot for the user to choose from.

Booting from native encrypted filesystem
----------------------------------------

Although there is currently no support for native encryption in ZFS On
Linux, there is a patch floating around 'out there' and the initrd
supports loading key and unlock such encrypted filesystem.

Separated filesystems
---------------------

Descended filesystems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If there are separate filesystems (for example a separate dataset for
/usr), the snapshot boot code will try to find the snapshot under each
filesystems and clone (or rollback) them.

Example:

::

   rpool/ROOT/debian@some_snapshot
   rpool/ROOT/debian/usr@some_snapshot

These will create the following filesystems respectively (if not doing a
rollback):

::

   rpool/ROOT/debian_some_snapshot
   rpool/ROOT/debian/usr_some_snapshot

The initrd code will use the mountpoint option (if any) in the original
(without the snapshot part) dataset to find *where* it should mount the
dataset. Or it will use the name of the dataset below the root
filesystem (rpool/ROOT/debian in this example) for the mount point.
