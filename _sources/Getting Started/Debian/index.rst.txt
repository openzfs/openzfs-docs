Installation
------------

If you want to use ZFS as your root filesystem, see the `Root on ZFS`_
links below instead.

ZFS packages are included in the `contrib repository
<https://packages.debian.org/source/zfs-linux>`__. The
`backports repository <https://backports.debian.org/Instructions/>`__
often provides newer releases of ZFS. You can use it as follows.

Add the backports repository::

  vi /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bookworm-backports.list

.. code-block:: sourceslist

   deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-backports main contrib
   deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-backports main contrib

::

  vi /etc/apt/preferences.d/90_zfs

.. code-block:: control

  Package: src:zfs-linux
  Pin: release n=bookworm-backports
  Pin-Priority: 990

Install the packages::

  apt update
  apt install dpkg-dev linux-headers-generic linux-image-generic
  apt install zfs-dkms zfsutils-linux

**Caution**: If you are in a poorly configured environment (e.g. certain VM or container consoles), when apt attempts to pop up a message on first install, it may fail to notice a real console is unavailable, and instead appear to hang indefinitely. To circumvent this, you can prefix the `apt install` commands with ``DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive``, like this::

  DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt install zfs-dkms zfsutils-linux
